::: {.callout-note} 
This dough aims for the "sweet spot" of handling—wet enough to generate significant steam and open crumb, but dry enough to be shaped by hand. The inclusion of olive oil coats the gluten strands, increasing extensibility and shelf life.
:::

### Ingredients

*   420 g (1 ¾ c + 2 tbsp) warm water, 30–32 °C (86–90 °F)
*   7 g (2 ¼ t) instant yeast
*   20 g (1 ½ T) sugar
*   20 g (1 ½ T) olive oil
*   15 g (2 ½ t) salt
*   680 g (3 ¾ c) all-purpose flour

### Mixing the Dough:

1.  Combine the warm water in a tall, lidded 6-qt container. 
2.  Stir in the yeast until dissolved.
3.  Add the sugar, olive oil, and salt to the water mixture.
4.  Gradually stir in the flour with a sturdy spoon until a shaggy mass forms.  
5.  **Finish Mixing**: Wet your hands and gently squeeze the dough until it is homogenous. Alternatively, you can use a stiff silicone spatula to fold and press the dough against the side of the container until combined.
    *   *Note*: If the dough feels too wet, you can perform one set of "stretch and folds" after 15 minutes. This builds gluten structure and makes the dough smoother and less sticky.

### Resting the Dough:

1.  Cover the dough and let it rest at room temperature for 20-25 minutes, or until it has risen by about 50%. 

### Optional Same-Day Use:

1.  If you don't want to wait overnight, you can continue to ferment the dough at room temperature for an additional 90 minutes.

### Refrigerating the Dough (Optimal):

::: {.callout-note}
Letting the dough rest for 24-72 hours in the refrigerator slows the yeast activity but allows enzymatic activity (protease and amyase) to continue. This adds significant flavor depth.
:::

1.  Transfer the dough container to the refrigerator.
2.  The dough can be stored in the fridge for up to 7 days.
    *   **Pro Tip (The Continuous Cycle)**: For the best results and convenience, try to get into a "Make one, Bake one" cycle. Whenever you pull a matured dough out of the fridge to bake, mix a new batch immediately and put it in. This ensures you always have a 24-72 hour fermented dough ready to go.



## Homemade Naan (v2 - Tandoor Simulation)

Attribution: Based on the [Homemade Naan recipe](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/homemade-naan.html) from Once Upon a Chef, with significant technique modifications to simulate a tandoor oven.

### Ingredients

#### For the Dough (Hybrid Leavening):
*   240-360g all-purpose flour
*   13g sugar
*   3g instant dry yeast/rapid-rise yeast
*   4g baking powder
*   6g salt
*   60ml plain Greek yogurt
*   30ml extra virgin olive oil
*   180ml warm water (about 38°C / 100°F)

#### For Cooking & Finishing:
*   Water (for moistening)
*   28g (2 tbsp) melted salted butter (for brushing)
*   3g dried parsley or fresh cilantro (optional)

### Equipment
*   **A well-seasoned cast-iron skillet is essential for this technique.**
*   Gas or high-output electric stovetop.

### Instructions

1.  **Activate Yeast & Mix Wet Ingredients**: In a medium bowl, whisk together the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5 minutes until foamy. Whisk in the Greek yogurt and olive oil.
2.  **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
3.  **Combine and Knead**: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Mix with a fork until a shaggy dough forms. Dust your hands with flour and gently knead the dough in the bowl for 1-2 minutes until it comes together into a soft, slightly sticky ball.
4.  **Rise**: Lightly oil a clean bowl, transfer the dough to it, and cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Let it rise in a warm place for 1 to 1½ hours, or until it has roughly doubled in size.
5.  **Divide and Rest**: Turn the risen dough onto a lightly floured surface. Divide it into six equal portions. Roll each portion into a smooth ball. Cover the balls with a towel and let them rest for 10 minutes.
6.  **Shape the Naan**: Working with one ball at a time, roll it into a teardrop or oval shape, about 3mm (⅛-inch) thick.


### The Cast Iron Inversion Technique

**This method simulates the intense, multi-directional heat of a tandoor. Read all steps before starting, as the process is fast.**

7.  **Preheat Skillet**: Place your cast-iron skillet on the stovetop over high heat. Heat it until it is smoking hot. This can take 5-10 minutes. Proper preheating is critical.
8.  **Moisten and Apply**: While the skillet heats, take one of your rolled-out naan. Lightly brush one side with water. Carefully place the water-side-down naan onto the hot skillet. The steam will make it stick to the surface.
9.  **Cook the Bottom**: Let the naan cook for about 60-90 seconds. You will see large bubbles forming on the top surface.
10. **Invert and Char the Top**: **Carefully invert the entire skillet**, holding it about 4-6 inches above the gas flame or electric coil. The naan will stay stuck to the pan. Move the skillet around to expose the top surface of the naan directly to the heat source. Cook for another 60-90 seconds, or until the top is blistered and charred in spots.
11. **Remove and Finish**: Turn the skillet back upright and use tongs to remove the finished naan. Brush immediately with melted butter and sprinkle with herbs, if using. Place the finished naan in a covered dish or wrap it in a towel to keep it warm and soft while you cook the rest.
12. **Repeat**: Repeat the process with the remaining dough balls, ensuring the skillet gets back to smoking hot between each one.

::: {.callout-note}
You can use the everything bread dough above to make pizza too, but if you have the time and energy this recipe is much more complex.
:::

### Ingredients

*   360ml warm water (45°C / 110°F)
*   7g active dry yeast
*   2g brown sugar
*   30ml olive oil
*   6g salt
*   400g all-purpose flour, divided

### Directions

1.  Stir together warm water, yeast, and brown sugar in a large mixing bowl; let sit for 10 minutes.
2.  Stir oil and salt into yeast mixture. Mix in 300g flour until incorporated. Turn dough out onto a clean, floured surface. Knead dough, adding remaining flour, a little at a time, until dough is no longer sticky. Place dough into an oiled bowl.
3.  Cover with a towel and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
4.  Punch down dough and form it into a tight ball. Allow dough to relax for 1 minute before rolling out.
5.  Preheat the oven to 220°C (425°F).
6.  If baking dough on a pizza stone, place toppings on dough and bake immediately. If baking dough on a pan, lightly oil the pan and let dough rise for 15 to 20 minutes before topping and baking it.
7.  Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and crust is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.



## Basic White Sandwich Bread

### Yields

2 (20cm) loaves

### Ingredients

*   240ml warm water
*   6g active dry yeast
*   240ml milk (any kind)
*   28g (2 tbsp) unsalted butter, melted
*   25g granulated sugar
*   18g salt
*   660-780g all-purpose flour, divided
*   Neutral-tasting oil, such as canola
*   Cooking spray (optional)

### Instructions

1.  **Proof the yeast.** Make sure the water is warm to the touch. If you can't comfortably hold your finger in the water for several seconds, wait for it to cool. Pour the water into the bowl of a stand mixer or large bowl and sprinkle the yeast over top. Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.
2.  **Start the dough.** Place the milk, butter, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl and stir to combine. Transfer to the bowl with the yeast, add 120g of the flour, and stir until it forms a loose, lumpy batter.
3.  **Add the flour.** Add 540g of the flour, reserving the remaining flour if the dough is sticky during kneading. Stir until a floury, shaggy dough is formed.
4.  **Knead the dough.** Using the dough hook attachment on a stand mixer on medium speed, knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes. (Alternatively, knead the dough by hand on the counter.) If the dough is bubble-gum sticky against the sides of the bowl or the counter, add extra flour a tablespoon at a time until it is no longer sticky. The dough is kneaded and ready when it is smooth, feels slightly tacky, forms a ball without sagging, and springs back when poked.
5.  **Do the first rise.** Remove the dough from the stand mixer bowl. Clean and dry the mixing bowl. Coat with a thin film of oil. Form the dough into a ball, place it in the bowl, and turn it to coat all over with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and let the rise in a warm spot until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
6.  **Shape the dough.** Sprinkle a little flour on a work surface and place the dough on top. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and shape each piece into a loose ball. Let the balls rest for 10 minutes.
7.  **Do the second rise in the loaf pans.** Grease 2 (20cm by 10cm) loaf pans with oil or coat them with cooking spray. Shape each ball of dough into a loaf (see Recipe Notes below for instructions or this tutorial for photos) and transfer to the loaf pans. It's important that the surface of the loaves be stretched taut; this helps them rise evenly and keep its shape. If your loaf still seems a little loose after the initial folding, just fold it in half again and pinch it closed. We do this by pressing the middle down and drawing up the sides.
8.  **Heat the oven to 220°C (425°F).** Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven, remove any racks above it, and heat the oven to 220°C (425°F) about halfway through the second rise.
9.  **Slash the loaves and bake.** Using a serrated knife, make a long, shallow slash down the center of each loaf. Place them in the oven. Immediately turn down the heat to 190°C (375°F) and bake 30 to 35 minutes. Finished loaves will be dark golden-brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Remove the loaves from the pans onto wire racks and let cool completely before slicing.

### Recipe Notes

*   **Storage**: Loaves wrapped in foil and plastic will keep at room temperature for several days or freeze for up to 3 months.
*   **How to Form Loaves**: 
    1.  **Flatten into a rectangle.** Use the heels of your hands to gently flatten the round into a rough rectangle. If the dough is sticking to the counter, sprinkle a little flour underneath. Try not to use too much flour, though, or else you'll have trouble getting the dough to stick to itself once you shape.
    2.  **Fold the bottom third up.** This part is like folding a letter! Fold the bottom third of the dough over on itself.
    3.  **Fold the top third down.** Then fold the top of the dough down so that it overlaps the other layers.
    4.  **Pinch closed.** Use your fingers to pinch the dough closed where the top layer meets the bottom layers. Don't forget the sides!
    5.  **Fold the dough again.** The goal is to get the surface of the loaf as taut as possible. This will help the loaf rise evenly and keep its shape. If your loaf still seems a little loose after the initial folding, just fold it in half again and pinch it closed. We do this by pressing the middle down and drawing up the sides.
    6.  **Invert the loaf into the pan.** Roll the loaf over until the seam is facing down and then gently place the loaf into the pan. The seams should be on the bottom with the tight surface facing up.

## The "Considered Average" Shokupan (Japanese Milk Bread)

Attribution: Internal comparative analysis and formulation.

### Ingredients

#### For the Tangzhong (Water Roux)

*   25g (3 tbsp) All-Purpose Flour
*   60ml (1/4 cup) Whole Milk
*   60ml (1/4 cup) Water

#### For the Main Dough

*   325g (2 2/3 cups) All-Purpose Flour
*   35g (2 1/2 tbsp) Granulated Sugar
*   20g (2 tbsp) Nonfat Milk Powder (See Chef's Note)
*   5g (1 1/2 tsp) Instant Yeast
*   8g (1 1/2 tsp) Fine Sea Salt
*   50g (1 large) Whole Egg, room temperature
*   120ml (1/2 cup) Whole Milk, lukewarm
*   45g (3 tbsp) Unsalted Butter, softened

#### For Brushing (Optional)

*   1 large Egg
*   15ml (1 tbsp) Water or Milk

### Instructions

#### Phase 1: The Tangzhong (Pre-Gelatinization)

1.  **Combine**: In a small saucepan, whisk the flour, milk, and water until smooth.
2.  **Heat**: Place over medium-low heat. Stir constantly with a whisk or silicone spatula.
3.  **Observation**: The mixture will first froth, then liquid will evaporate, and it will suddenly thicken into a paste.
4.  **Endpoint**: Cook until the whisk leaves lines in the mixture that do not immediately fill back in (approx 65°C / 149°F).
5.  **Cool**: Transfer to the mixing bowl. **Crucial**: Let it cool to room temperature (or at least lukewarm). Adding yeast to hot Tangzhong will kill the yeast.

#### Phase 2: Mixing and Autolyse

1.  **Layer**: In the bowl with the cooled Tangzhong, add the lukewarm milk, egg, sugar, and yeast. Whisk to break up the Tangzhong and dissolve the sugar.
2.  **Add Flour**: Dump in the flour and salt.
3.  **Shaggy Mix**: Mix on low speed (or by hand) just until no dry flour remains. It will look rough.
4.  **Rest (Autolyse)**: Cover the bowl and walk away for 20 minutes. This allows the flour to absorb the liquid fully and proteins to align naturally, reducing the need for mechanical kneading.

#### Phase 3: Kneading and Fat Integration

1.  **Develop**: After the rest, knead on medium-low speed for 5-7 minutes. The dough should smooth out.
2.  **Butter Addition**: Add the softened butter in two batches. Wait for the first piece to disappear before adding the next.
3.  **Final Knead**: Knead for another 5 minutes. The dough should be tacky (sticky to the touch) but not messy. It should pass the "Windowpane Test"—stretching translucent without tearing.

#### Phase 4: Bulk Fermentation

1.  **Rise**: Form into a ball. Place in a greased bowl and cover.
2.  **Environment**: Let rise for 1 to 1.5 hours at warm room temperature (24°C / 75°F).
3.  **Cue**: Stop when the dough has just doubled. Do not let it triple, or the structure will collapse.

#### Phase 5: Shaping (The 3-Fold Method)

1.  **Divide**: Punch down the dough gently. Weigh total dough (approx 650g) and divide into 3 equal pieces (~215g each).
2.  **Bench Rest**: Round into balls. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes to relax the tension.
3.  **Lamination**:
    *   Take one ball. Roll it out into a long oval (approx 8-10 inches).
    *   Fold the right third into the middle. Fold the left third over that (like a letter).
    *   Use the rolling pin to flatten this strip slightly.
    *   Roll the strip up from the short end into a tight cylinder (swiss roll style).
4.  **Pan**: Place the three cylinders into a greased 9x5 inch loaf pan, seam side down.

#### Phase 6: Final Proof and Bake

1.  **Proof**: Cover the pan. Let rise until the dough is about 1 inch below the rim of the pan (for a flat top) or just crowning the rim (for a domed top). This takes 45-60 minutes.
2.  **Bake**: Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F). Brush the top with an egg wash (beaten egg with a splash of water) for shine if desired. Bake for 30-35 minutes.
3.  **Finish**: The bread is done when the internal temperature reads 88°C (190°F). Remove from pan immediately to a wire rack.

### Chef's Note: Dinner Rolls Variation

This dough makes excellent, fluffy dinner rolls.

*   **Shaping**: At the shaping step, instead of three cylinders divide the dough into 50-60g portions and roll into tight balls.
*   **Pan Size**: For a standard 9x13 inch baking pan, you will need to **double the recipe**. This will yield 20-24 rolls (arranged 4x5 or 4x6). A single batch fits well in a 9x9 inch square pan (9 large rolls).
*   **Baking**: Proof until the rolls are puffy and touching. Bake at 175°C (350°F) for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 88°C (190°F).
*   **The Milk Powder Hack**: To address the "light" flavor of earlier tests, I've added **Nonfat Milk Powder**. This adds the signature milky aroma and richness without messing up the water/hydration ratios.
    *   **Substitute**: If you don't stock this, you can omit it, but the bread will be less fragrant. Alternatively, replace the 120ml liquid milk with **Evaporated Milk** for a similar boost.

**Legacy Recipe / Paywall Archive**: This recipe is preserved here because the original source is often behind a paywall.

**Comparison**: While I almost exclusively use the **"Everything Dough"** recipe above (which produces a similar result in less time with easier handling), this recipe is still useful if you want the specific chemical effects of a very long, high-hydration bulk ferment (super-open, custardy crumb) and have 18+ hours to wait.

Very low yeast, high hydration dough that requires a long rise at room temperature to build gluten.
:::

### Ingredients

* 3 ⅓ cups (430 g)  all purpose flour
* 2 tsp (8g) kosher salt or 1 ½ tsp if using table salt
* ¼ tsp (~1g) active dry yeast
* 1 ½ cups (~350 ml)  warm water

### Instructions

1. Mix all ingredients until a sticky dough forms.
2. Cover and let rise, ideally 12+ hours. (Put in the refrigerator if > 18hrs or so)
3. Flour surface. (Let come up to room temp if refrigerated). Turn out dough and do a few tuck and folds. 
4. Form into ball, cover, and let rise on parchment paper greased with olive oil until doubled in size (~ 2 hrs). 
5. Pre-heat oven with dutch oven inside to 450°F (230°C). 
6. (optional) just cover bottom of dutch oven with olive oil before placing dough into dutch oven. Score the dough.
7. Bake with lid on for 30 minutes. 
8. Remove lid and bake until nicely browned and crust is well formed, ~15-30 more minutes.



## The Perfect British-Style Scone for the American Kitchen

There is a moment of pure, simple bliss that comes from breaking open a warm, freshly baked scone. Not the dense, sugar-laden triangles you might find at a coffee shop, but a true British scone—impossibly light, flaky, and buttery, with a golden top and a soft, tender crumb. It's a taste of tradition, a cornerstone of the classic "cream tea."

This recipe bridges the gap between the hallowed halls of British baking and the modern American kitchen. We’ll use ingredients that are easy to find, like all-purpose flour and buttermilk, and employ simple techniques to achieve that authentic, melt-in-your-mouth texture. Forget dry, heavy scones; these are lofty, elegant, and ready to be slathered with your favorite jam and a dollop of cream.

### The Four Secrets to a Perfect Scone

*   **Cold Ingredients are Non-Negotiable**: Your butter and liquids must be very cold. When small pieces of cold butter hit the hot oven, they release steam, creating tiny pockets of air that result in a light, flaky texture.
*   **A Gentle Hand is Key**: Overworking the dough develops gluten, which leads to tough, chewy scones. Mix until the ingredients are just combined. A shaggy, slightly sticky dough is a good sign.
*   **Pat, Don’t Roll**: While you can use a rolling pin, gently patting the dough to thickness with your hands prevents over-compacting it, keeping the final product tender.
*   **Cut Cleanly**: When cutting your rounds, press the cutter straight down and pull it straight up. Don't twist! Twisting the cutter seals the edges of the scone, preventing it from rising to its full, glorious height.

### The Recipe

**Yields**: 8-10 (2.5-inch) scones
**Prep time**: 15 minutes
**Bake time**: 12-15 minutes

### Ingredients

*   360g All-Purpose Flour, plus more for dusting
*   50g Granulated Sugar
*   12g Baking Powder
*   3g Salt
*   113g (8 tbsp / 1 stick) Unsalted Butter, very cold, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
*   1 large Egg
*   180ml Buttermilk, very cold (see Baker's Notes for substitutions)
*   1 large Egg, beaten with 15ml of milk or cream (for the egg wash)

### Equipment

*   Large mixing bowl
*   Pastry blender or two knives (or a food processor)
*   2.5-inch round biscuit or cookie cutter
*   Baking sheet lined with parchment paper
*   Pastry brush

### Instructions

1.  **Prepare Your Station**: Preheat your oven to 200°C (400F). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
2.  **Combine Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt.
3.  **Cut in the Butter**: Add the cold, cubed butter to the flour mixture. Using a pastry blender or your fingertips, quickly cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces of butter still visible. (For modern convenience, you can pulse the dry ingredients and butter in a food processor 8-10 times until the correct texture is reached. Then, transfer to a bowl.)
4.  **Mix the Wet Ingredients**: In a separate small bowl, whisk the egg and the cold buttermilk together until just combined.
5.  **Form the Dough**: Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients. Use a fork or a spatula to mix until a shaggy, slightly sticky dough begins to form. Do not overmix! It's okay if there are a few dry patches.
6.  **A Quick Knead**: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently and quickly knead the dough just 3-4 times to bring it together into a cohesive ball. It should still look a little rough.
7.  **Pat and Cut**: Gently pat the dough into a round that is about 3/4-inch to 1-inch thick. Using a 2.5-inch round cutter dipped in flour, press straight down to cut out your scones. Do not twist the cutter. Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet, about an inch apart. Gently bring the scraps together, pat down, and cut out more scones until all the dough is used.
8.  **The Finishing Touch**: Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the tops (but not the sides) of the scones with the egg wash. This will give them a beautiful, glossy golden-brown finish.
9.  **Bake**: Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the scones have risen high and are a lovely golden brown.
10. **Cool**: Transfer the scones to a wire rack to cool slightly. They are best served warm on the day they are made.

### Baker's Notes, Variations & Serving

*   **Buttermilk Substitute**: If you don't have buttermilk, you can make a quick version. Add 1 tablespoon (15ml) of lemon juice or white vinegar to a measuring cup, then add enough whole milk to reach the 3/4-cup (180ml) line. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes before using. Alternatively, you can use heavy cream for a richer, more decadent scone.
*   **Classic Fruit Scones**: For a traditional variation, gently fold 85g of dried currants or raisins into the dough just before you turn it out onto your work surface.
*   **Savory Cheese Scones**: For a savory treat, reduce the sugar to 1 tablespoon. Add 113g of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and a pinch of cayenne pepper to the dry ingredients before cutting in the butter.
*   **Freezing for Later**: You can freeze unbaked scones for future convenience. Cut them out, place them on a tray, and freeze until solid. Transfer to a freezer bag. They can be baked directly from frozen; just add 2-4 minutes to the baking time.
*   **How to Serve a Proper Scone**: A "Cream Tea" is the traditional way to enjoy scones. This involves serving them with clotted cream and strawberry or raspberry jam. As clotted cream can be hard to find in the U.S., here are some excellent alternatives:
    *   **Mock Clotted Cream**: Beat 1 cup (240ml) of cold heavy cream to stiff peaks. In a separate bowl, whisk 113g of mascarpone cheese with 8g of powdered sugar until smooth. Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone.
    *   **Lightly Sweetened Whipped Cream**: A simple and delicious option.
    *   **Crème Fraîche**: Offers a wonderful tangy richness.
