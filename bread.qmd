## Homemade Naan (Modified)

Attribution: Based on the [Homemade Naan recipe](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/homemade-naan.html) from Once Upon a Chef.

### Ingredients

*   240-360g all-purpose flour
*   13g sugar
*   3g instant dry yeast/rapid-rise yeast
*   6g salt
*   45ml plain Greek yogurt
*   30ml extra virgin olive oil
*   180ml warm water (about 38°C / 100°F)

#### For Brushing

*   28g (2 tbsp) melted salted butter (for brushing on finished naans)
*   3g dried parsley (optional)

### Instructions

1.  **Mix the dry ingredients**: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt.
2.  **Mix the wet ingredients**: In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the Greek yogurt, olive oil, and warm water.
3.  **Combine and stir**: Add the yogurt mixture to the dry ingredients and mix with a fork until the dough starts to come together.
4.  **Knead**: Dust your hands with flour and gently knead the dough, adding more flour as needed (up to an additional 120g), until it forms a soft, slightly sticky ball that pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Stop kneading as soon as it comes together.
5.  **Rise**: Lightly oil a clean bowl, transfer the dough to it, and cover with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel. Let the dough rise in a warm place for 1 to 1½ hours, or until it has about doubled in size.
6.  **Prep and divide**: Dust a work surface with flour. Turn the risen dough onto the floured surface, shape it into a long rectangle, and cut it into six equal portions.
7.  **Heat the skillet**: Heat a large cast iron or heavy nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it is very hot.
8.  **Roll and cook**: While the skillet heats, roll one of the dough balls into an oval shape about ⅛-inch (3mm) thick. Gently place the dough in the hot, dry skillet. Cook until bubbles form and the bottom is browned in spots (a few minutes). Flip the naan and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the bottom is lightly browned and blistered.
9.  **Finish and serve**: Remove the naan from the skillet and brush with melted butter. Repeat with the remaining dough balls. Sprinkle with dried parsley, if desired, and serve warm.

### Notes on Modifications

*   **Anise Seeds**: The anise seeds were an optional ingredient in the original recipe, so they have been removed completely.
*   **Greek Yogurt**: Greek yogurt is thicker than regular plain yogurt. The recipe uses the same amount, which should work fine.
*   **Dried Parsley**: Dried herbs are more potent than fresh ones. A general rule of thumb is to use one-third the amount of dried herbs as you would fresh. The original recipe called for 1 tablespoon of fresh parsley, so this recipe uses 1 teaspoon (now 3g) of dried parsley.
*   **Flour**: Added up to 120g more flour to help the dough pull away from the bowl.

## Basic White Sandwich Bread

Attribution: [Basic White Sandwich Bread](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-basic-white-sandwich-bread-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-166588#post-recipe-11757) from The Kitchn.

### Yields

2 (20cm) loaves

### Ingredients

*   240ml warm water
*   6g active dry yeast
*   240ml milk (any kind)
*   28g (2 tbsp) unsalted butter, melted
*   25g granulated sugar
*   18g salt
*   660-780g all-purpose flour, divided
*   Neutral-tasting oil, such as canola
*   Cooking spray (optional)

### Instructions

1.  **Proof the yeast.** Make sure the water is warm to the touch. If you can't comfortably hold your finger in the water for several seconds, wait for it to cool. Pour the water into the bowl of a stand mixer or large bowl and sprinkle the yeast over top. Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.
2.  **Start the dough.** Place the milk, butter, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl and stir to combine. Transfer to the bowl with the yeast, add 120g of the flour, and stir until it forms a loose, lumpy batter.
3.  **Add the flour.** Add 540g of the flour, reserving the remaining flour if the dough is sticky during kneading. Stir until a floury, shaggy dough is formed.
4.  **Knead the dough.** Using the dough hook attachment on a stand mixer on medium speed, knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes. (Alternatively, knead the dough by hand on the counter.) If the dough is bubble-gum sticky against the sides of the bowl or the counter, add extra flour a tablespoon at a time until it is no longer sticky. The dough is kneaded and ready when it is smooth, feels slightly tacky, forms a ball without sagging, and springs back when poked.
5.  **Do the first rise.** Remove the dough from the stand mixer bowl. Clean and dry the mixing bowl. Coat with a thin film of oil. Form the dough into a ball, place it in the bowl, and turn it to coat all over with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and let the rise in a warm spot until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
6.  **Shape the dough.** Sprinkle a little flour on a work surface and place the dough on top. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and shape each piece into a loose ball. Let the balls rest for 10 minutes.
7.  **Do the second rise in the loaf pans.** Grease 2 (20cm by 10cm) loaf pans with oil or coat them with cooking spray. Shape each ball of dough into a loaf (see Recipe Notes below for instructions or this tutorial for photos) and transfer to the loaf pans. It's important that the surface of the loaves be stretched taut; this helps them rise evenly and keep its shape. If your loaf still seems a little loose after the initial folding, just fold it in half again and pinch it closed. We do this by pressing the middle down and drawing up the sides.
8.  **Heat the oven to 220°C (425°F).** Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven, remove any racks above it, and heat the oven to 220°C (425°F) about halfway through the second rise.
9.  **Slash the loaves and bake.** Using a serrated knife, make a long, shallow slash down the center of each loaf. Place them in the oven. Immediately turn down the heat to 190°C (375°F) and bake 30 to 35 minutes. Finished loaves will be dark golden-brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Remove the loaves from the pans onto wire racks and let cool completely before slicing.

### Recipe Notes

*   **Storage**: Loaves wrapped in foil and plastic will keep at room temperature for several days or freeze for up to 3 months.
*   **How to Form Loaves**: 
    1.  **Flatten into a rectangle.** Use the heels of your hands to gently flatten the round into a rough rectangle. If the dough is sticking to the counter, sprinkle a little flour underneath. Try not to use too much flour, though, or else you'll have trouble getting the dough to stick to itself once you shape.
    2.  **Fold the bottom third up.** This part is like folding a letter! Fold the bottom third of the dough over on itself.
    3.  **Fold the top third down.** Then fold the top of the dough down so that it overlaps the other layers.
    4.  **Pinch closed.** Use your fingers to pinch the dough closed where the top layer meets the bottom layers. Don't forget the sides!
    5.  **Fold the dough again.** The goal is to get the surface of the loaf as taut as possible. This will help the loaf rise evenly and keep its shape. If your loaf still seems a little loose after the initial folding, just fold it in half again and pinch it closed. We do this by pressing the middle down and drawing up the sides.
    6.  **Invert the loaf into the pan.** Roll the loaf over until the seam is facing down and then gently place the loaf into the pan. The seams should be on the bottom with the tight surface facing up.

## The Perfect British-Style Scone for the American Kitchen

There is a moment of pure, simple bliss that comes from breaking open a warm, freshly baked scone. Not the dense, sugar-laden triangles you might find at a coffee shop, but a true British scone—impossibly light, flaky, and buttery, with a golden top and a soft, tender crumb. It's a taste of tradition, a cornerstone of the classic "cream tea."

This recipe bridges the gap between the hallowed halls of British baking and the modern American kitchen. We’ll use ingredients that are easy to find, like all-purpose flour and buttermilk, and employ simple techniques to achieve that authentic, melt-in-your-mouth texture. Forget dry, heavy scones; these are lofty, elegant, and ready to be slathered with your favorite jam and a dollop of cream.

### The Four Secrets to a Perfect Scone

*   **Cold Ingredients are Non-Negotiable**: Your butter and liquids must be very cold. When small pieces of cold butter hit the hot oven, they release steam, creating tiny pockets of air that result in a light, flaky texture.
*   **A Gentle Hand is Key**: Overworking the dough develops gluten, which leads to tough, chewy scones. Mix until the ingredients are just combined. A shaggy, slightly sticky dough is a good sign.
*   **Pat, Don’t Roll**: While you can use a rolling pin, gently patting the dough to thickness with your hands prevents over-compacting it, keeping the final product tender.
*   **Cut Cleanly**: When cutting your rounds, press the cutter straight down and pull it straight up. Don't twist! Twisting the cutter seals the edges of the scone, preventing it from rising to its full, glorious height.

### The Recipe

**Yields**: 8-10 (2.5-inch) scones
**Prep time**: 15 minutes
**Bake time**: 12-15 minutes

### Ingredients

*   360g All-Purpose Flour, plus more for dusting
*   50g Granulated Sugar
*   12g Baking Powder
*   3g Salt
*   113g (8 tbsp / 1 stick) Unsalted Butter, very cold, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
*   1 large Egg
*   180ml Buttermilk, very cold (see Baker's Notes for substitutions)
*   1 large Egg, beaten with 15ml of milk or cream (for the egg wash)

### Equipment

*   Large mixing bowl
*   Pastry blender or two knives (or a food processor)
*   2.5-inch round biscuit or cookie cutter
*   Baking sheet lined with parchment paper
*   Pastry brush

### Instructions

1.  **Prepare Your Station**: Preheat your oven to 200°C (400F). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
2.  **Combine Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt.
3.  **Cut in the Butter**: Add the cold, cubed butter to the flour mixture. Using a pastry blender or your fingertips, quickly cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces of butter still visible. (For modern convenience, you can pulse the dry ingredients and butter in a food processor 8-10 times until the correct texture is reached. Then, transfer to a bowl.)
4.  **Mix the Wet Ingredients**: In a separate small bowl, whisk the egg and the cold buttermilk together until just combined.
5.  **Form the Dough**: Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients. Use a fork or a spatula to mix until a shaggy, slightly sticky dough begins to form. Do not overmix! It's okay if there are a few dry patches.
6.  **A Quick Knead**: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently and quickly knead the dough just 3-4 times to bring it together into a cohesive ball. It should still look a little rough.
7.  **Pat and Cut**: Gently pat the dough into a round that is about 3/4-inch to 1-inch thick. Using a 2.5-inch round cutter dipped in flour, press straight down to cut out your scones. Do not twist the cutter. Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet, about an inch apart. Gently bring the scraps together, pat down, and cut out more scones until all the dough is used.
8.  **The Finishing Touch**: Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the tops (but not the sides) of the scones with the egg wash. This will give them a beautiful, glossy golden-brown finish.
9.  **Bake**: Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the scones have risen high and are a lovely golden brown.
10. **Cool**: Transfer the scones to a wire rack to cool slightly. They are best served warm on the day they are made.

### Baker's Notes, Variations & Serving

*   **Buttermilk Substitute**: If you don't have buttermilk, you can make a quick version. Add 1 tablespoon (15ml) of lemon juice or white vinegar to a measuring cup, then add enough whole milk to reach the 3/4-cup (180ml) line. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes before using. Alternatively, you can use heavy cream for a richer, more decadent scone.
*   **Classic Fruit Scones**: For a traditional variation, gently fold 85g of dried currants or raisins into the dough just before you turn it out onto your work surface.
*   **Savory Cheese Scones**: For a savory treat, reduce the sugar to 1 tablespoon. Add 113g of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and a pinch of cayenne pepper to the dry ingredients before cutting in the butter.
*   **Freezing for Later**: You can freeze unbaked scones for future convenience. Cut them out, place them on a tray, and freeze until solid. Transfer to a freezer bag. They can be baked directly from frozen; just add 2-4 minutes to the baking time.
*   **How to Serve a Proper Scone**: A "Cream Tea" is the traditional way to enjoy scones. This involves serving them with clotted cream and strawberry or raspberry jam. As clotted cream can be hard to find in the U.S., here are some excellent alternatives:
    *   **Mock Clotted Cream**: Beat 1 cup (240ml) of cold heavy cream to stiff peaks. In a separate bowl, whisk 113g of mascarpone cheese with 8g of powdered sugar until smooth. Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone.
    *   **Lightly Sweetened Whipped Cream**: A simple and delicious option.
    *   **Crème Fraîche**: Offers a wonderful tangy richness.
