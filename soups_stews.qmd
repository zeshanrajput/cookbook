# Soups & Stews

## My take on a "medieval" stew

As I understand it, innkeepers in medieval times would keep a pot on simmer. As people took a serving out of the pot, they would add whatever they had (meat, vegetables, etc.) to the stew. Because I have gout, I've made some notes to help lower purine. 

### Foundational Principles

Keep these in mind for gout-friendliness:

*   **Protein**: For low-purine options. Chicken (breast is best), turkey, or lean fish. Avoid organ meats, red meats, and shellfish.
*   **Thickener**: Use starches like flour, cornstarch, rice, or potatoes to thicken the stew.
*   **Flavor**: Rely on a base of vegetables, herbs, and spices rather than high-purine meat broths.

### 1. Building the Flavor Base (The Sauté)

This is the most important step for a rich, deep flavor. This is where you start your stew.

*   **Fats**: 15-30ml of olive oil.
*   **Aromatics**: Always start with these. Finely chop onions, shallots, or garlic. Sauté them until they are soft and translucent.
*   **"Long-Cooking" Vegetables**: These need a head start to become tender. Add these after the aromatics and sauté them for a few minutes.
    *   Carrots
    *   Celery
    *   Parsnips
    *   Turnips
    *   Hard squash (like butternut or pumpkin)

### 2. Adding the Protein and Spices

Once your flavor base is sautéed, it's time to bring in the main ingredients.

1.  **Protein**: Add your cubed chicken or turkey. Sauté it until it's lightly browned on all sides. This adds a great layer of flavor.
2.  **Dry Spices**: Add your spices now, such as paprika, cumin, oregano, black pepper, and a very small amount of cloves or cardamom. Sautéing the spices for about a minute will "bloom" them and release their full aroma.
3.  **Thickener (if using flour)**: Sprinkle about 30ml of flour over the ingredients. Stir constantly for 1-2 minutes until it coats everything and forms a paste.

### 3. The Simmering Stage

Now you add the liquid and the ingredients that need a long time to cook through.

1.  **Liquid**: Slowly pour in your unsalted broth or water, stirring to prevent any lumps from forming if you used flour. Add enough liquid to just barely cover the ingredients.
2.  **"Hard" Ingredients**: Add any ingredients that require a long cooking time to become tender and help thicken the stew.
    *   Potatoes (cut into large chunks)
    *   Rice (120ml is a good start)
    *   Bay leaves
3.  **Simmer**: Bring the stew to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cover the pot and let it cook for at least 30-45 minutes.

### 4. Finishing the Stew

Towards the end of the cooking process, add the ingredients that cook more quickly.

1.  **"Quick-Cooking" Vegetables**: These will become mushy if added too early. Add these 15-20 minutes before the stew is done.
    *   Bell peppers
    *   Cabbage
    *   Zucchini or summer squash
    *   Mushrooms
2.  **Remaining Thickener**: If you didn't use flour and the stew isn't as thick as you want, mix cornstarch with a little cold water to make a slurry. Stir it in and simmer until thickened.
3.  **Seasoning and Fresh Herbs**: Once the stew is ready, remove the bay leaves. Taste and add salt as needed. Stir in fresh herbs like chopped parsley or basil to add a bright flavor.

### Ingredients

#### For the Chicken
*   500g (1.1 lbs) boneless, skinless chicken thighs
*   15ml (1 tbsp) canola oil / vegetable oil
*   11.25g (2.25 tsp) cumin
*   3.75g (0.75 tsp) allspice
*   2.5g (½ tsp) ground cardamom
*   2.5g (½ tsp) paprika
*   5g (1 tsp) salt

#### For the Soup
*   100g (1/2 cup) dried Great Northern or cannellini beans
*   28g (2 tbsp) butter
*   1 onion, finely chopped
*   10g (2 tsp) crushed garlic
*   5g (1 tsp) crushed ginger
*   7.5g (1.5 tsp) cumin
*   2.5g (0.5 tsp) allspice
*   5g (1 tsp) paprika
*   5g (1 tsp) ground cardamom
*   5g (1 tsp) turmeric (optional, for color)
*   170g (6 oz) tomato paste
*   960ml (4 cups) chicken stock
*   5-10g (1-2 tsp) salt
*   5g (1 tsp) pepper
*   5g (1 tsp) sugar
*   360ml (1.5 cups) heavy / whipping cream

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Beans
1.  **Soak the beans**: The night before, rinse the dried beans and place them in a large bowl with enough water to cover them by at least 2 inches. Let them soak overnight.
2.  **Cook the beans**: Drain the soaked beans.
    *   **Stovetop**: Place the beans in a pot with fresh water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 1-1.5 hours, or until tender.
    *   **Pressure Cooker / Instant Pot**: Place the beans in the pressure cooker with fresh water to cover. Cook on high pressure for 10-15 minutes, followed by a natural pressure release.
    Once cooked, drain the beans and set them aside.

#### Make the Soup
1.  **Slice and season the chicken**: Slice the chicken into small, bite-size pieces. In a medium bowl, toss the chicken with the oil, cumin, allspice, cardamom, paprika, and salt.
2.  **Sear the chicken**: In a large, deep pot, sear the chicken until browned on both sides. Remove from the pot and set aside.
3.  **Sauté aromatics**: In the same pot, melt the butter then add the onion, garlic, and ginger. Cook until fragrant.
4.  **Toast spices and bloom tomato paste**: Add the remaining spices (and turmeric, if using) and the tomato paste to the pot. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the spices are fragrant and the tomato paste has deepened in color.
5.  **Simmer the sauce with beans**: Pour in the chicken stock, add the cooked beans, and stir to combine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it cook for 10 minutes.
6.  **Purée the sauce**: Use an immersion blender to blend the sauce and beans until completely smooth and creamy.
7.  **Add chicken**: Return the seared chicken to the puréed sauce and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.
8.  **Finish the soup**: Stir in the heavy cream and season with salt, pepper, and sugar.
9.  **Serve**: Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with a drizzle of cream, fresh cilantro, and fresh chilies (optional).

### Chef's Notes

*   **Bouillon Substitute**: If you don't have chicken stock on hand, you can use bouillon cubes or powder. A good rule of thumb is 1 teaspoon of bouillon powder or 1 cube per cup (240ml) of water. For this recipe, you would use 4 teaspoons of powder or 4 cubes dissolved in 960ml (4 cups) of water.
*   **Milk Substitute for Cream**: If you don't have heavy cream, you can use whole milk with a few adjustments. To achieve a similar richness and prevent curdling, reduce the chicken stock by 1 cup (240ml). Before adding the milk, temper it by slowly whisking about a cup of the hot soup into the milk. Then, stir the warmed milk mixture back into the pot. For extra richness, you can also add another tablespoon of butter at this stage.
*   **Canned Bean Shortcut**: To save time, you can use one 15 oz (425g) can of Great Northern or cannellini beans. Simply rinse and drain them, skip the "Prepare the Beans" section, and add them to the soup along with the chicken stock.
*   **Canned Chicken Variation**: For an even quicker soup, you can substitute one 12.5 oz (355g) can of cooked chicken breast. If you do, you can skip the "Slice and season the chicken" and "Sear the chicken" steps. Drain the chicken and add it to the soup for the final 10-15 minutes of simmering. Note that this will change the final flavor, as you will miss the depth developed from searing fresh chicken.
