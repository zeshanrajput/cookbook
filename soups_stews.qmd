# Soups & Stews

## My take on a "medieval" stew (v2)

As I understand it, innkeepers in medieval times would keep a pot on simmer. As people took a serving out of the pot, they would add whatever they had (meat, vegetables, etc.) to the stew. Because I have gout, I've made some notes to help lower purine. This version is designed to create a deep, "meaty" flavor and a thicker consistency without using high-purine meat stocks.

:::{.callout-note}
To build a rich, savory flavor without meat stock, this recipe creates an "umami bomb" using the synergy between two key compounds:

*   **Glutamates**: Found in ingredients like tomato paste.
*   **Guanalytes**: Found in dried mushrooms (like shiitake or porcini).

Combining these doesn't just add flavor—it multiplies it, creating a "meaty" depth and mouthfeel that is crucial for a satisfying stew.

### Foundational Principles

Keep these in mind for gout-friendliness:

*   **Protein**: For low-purine options. Chicken (breast is best), turkey, or lean fish. Avoid organ meats, red meats, and shellfish.
*   **Thickener**: This recipe uses a **roux** (a cooked mixture of flour and fat) for a silky, thick consistency.
*   **Flavor**: We rely on a powerful base of aromatics, vegetables, and the "umami bomb" from dried mushrooms.

### Ingredients
*   **Dried Mushrooms**: 15g (0.5 oz) dried shiitake or porcini mushrooms
*   **Hot Water**: 240ml (1 cup) for rehydrating mushrooms
*   **Fats**: 45ml (3 tbsp) olive oil or other neutral oil
*   **Butter**: 30g (2 tbsp) unsalted butter
*   **Flour**: 30g (approx. 3 tbsp) all-purpose flour
*   **Aromatics**: 1 large onion, chopped; 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
*   **Mirepoix**: 2 carrots, chopped; 2 celery stalks, chopped
*   **"Long-Cooking" Vegetables**: Parsnips, turnips, hard squash (optional)
*   **Protein**: 500g cubed chicken breast or turkey
*   **Dry Spices**: Paprika, cumin, oregano, black pepper, and a very small amount of cloves or cardamom.
*   **Liquid**: 720ml (3 cups) unsalted chicken broth or vegetable broth
*   **"Hard" Ingredients**: 2 large potatoes, cut into chunks
*   **"Quick-Cooking" Vegetables**: Bell peppers, cabbage, zucchini (optional)

### Instructions

1.  **Create the Umami Base**: Place the dried mushrooms in a bowl and cover with the 240ml of hot water. Let them steep for 20-30 minutes. Once softened, remove the mushrooms, chop them finely, and **reserve the flavorful soaking liquid**.

2.  **Sauté Aromatics & Mushrooms**: In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, carrots, and celery (and other long-cooking vegetables, if using). Sauté for 8-10 minutes until softened. Add the garlic and the chopped, rehydrated mushrooms. Cook for another 2 minutes until fragrant.

3.  **Brown the Protein**: Add the cubed chicken or turkey to the pot. Sauté until it's lightly browned on all sides.

4.  **Make the Roux for Thickness**: Push the vegetables and meat to one side of the pot. Add the 30g of butter to the empty side. Once melted, sprinkle the 30g of flour over the butter and whisk them together to form a paste (the roux). Cook this paste, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. This cooks out the raw flour taste. Now, stir the roux into the meat and vegetable mixture until everything is coated.

5.  **Bloom Spices**: Add your dry spices (paprika, cumin, etc.) to the pot and stir for 1 minute until fragrant.

6.  **The Simmering Stage**: Slowly pour in the reserved mushroom soaking liquid and the 720ml of broth, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Add the potatoes and any bay leaves.

7.  **Simmer**: Bring the stew to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cover the pot and let it cook for at least 45-60 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and the flavors have melded. The stew should be noticeably thicker.

8.  **Finishing the Stew**: If using "quick-cooking" vegetables, add them in the last 15-20 minutes of cooking. Before serving, remove any bay leaves, taste, and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

### Ingredients

#### For the Chicken
*   500g (1.1 lbs) boneless, skinless chicken thighs
*   15ml (1 tbsp) canola oil / vegetable oil
*   11.25g (2.25 tsp) cumin
*   3.75g (0.75 tsp) allspice
*   2.5g (½ tsp) ground cardamom
*   2.5g (½ tsp) paprika
*   5g (1 tsp) salt

#### For the Soup
*   100g (1/2 cup) dried Great Northern or cannellini beans
*   28g (2 tbsp) butter
*   1 onion, finely chopped
*   10g (2 tsp) crushed garlic
*   5g (1 tsp) crushed ginger
*   7.5g (1.5 tsp) cumin
*   2.5g (0.5 tsp) allspice
*   5g (1 tsp) paprika
*   5g (1 tsp) ground cardamom
*   5g (1 tsp) turmeric (optional, for color)
*   170g (6 oz) tomato paste
*   960ml (4 cups) chicken stock
*   5-10g (1-2 tsp) salt
*   5g (1 tsp) pepper
*   5g (1 tsp) sugar
*   360ml (1.5 cups) heavy / whipping cream

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Beans
1.  **Soak the beans**: The night before, rinse the dried beans and place them in a large bowl with enough water to cover them by at least 2 inches. Let them soak overnight.
2.  **Cook the beans**: Drain the soaked beans.
    *   **Stovetop**: Place the beans in a pot with fresh water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 1-1.5 hours, or until tender.
    *   **Pressure Cooker / Instant Pot**: Place the beans in the pressure cooker with fresh water to cover. Cook on high pressure for 10-15 minutes, followed by a natural pressure release.
    Once cooked, drain the beans and set them aside.

#### Make the Soup
1.  **Slice and season the chicken**: Slice the chicken into small, bite-size pieces. In a medium bowl, toss the chicken with the oil, cumin, allspice, cardamom, paprika, and salt.
2.  **Sear the chicken**: In a large, deep pot, sear the chicken until browned on both sides. Remove from the pot and set aside.
3.  **Sauté aromatics**: In the same pot, melt the butter then add the onion, garlic, and ginger. Cook until fragrant.
4.  **Toast spices and bloom tomato paste**: Add the remaining spices (and turmeric, if using) and the tomato paste to the pot. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the spices are fragrant and the tomato paste has deepened in color.
5.  **Simmer the sauce with beans**: Pour in the chicken stock, add the cooked beans, and stir to combine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it cook for 10 minutes.
6.  **Purée the sauce**: Use an immersion blender to blend the sauce and beans until completely smooth and creamy.
7.  **Add chicken**: Return the seared chicken to the puréed sauce and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.
8.  **Finish the soup**: Stir in the heavy cream and season with salt, pepper, and sugar.
9.  **Serve**: Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with a drizzle of cream, fresh cilantro, and fresh chilies (optional).

### Chef's Notes

*   **Bouillon Substitute**: If you don't have chicken stock on hand, you can use bouillon cubes or powder. A good rule of thumb is 1 teaspoon of bouillon powder or 1 cube per cup (240ml) of water. For this recipe, you would use 4 teaspoons of powder or 4 cubes dissolved in 960ml (4 cups) of water.
*   **Milk Substitute for Cream**: If you don't have heavy cream, you can use whole milk with a few adjustments. To achieve a similar richness and prevent curdling, reduce the chicken stock by 1 cup (240ml). Before adding the milk, temper it by slowly whisking about a cup of the hot soup into the milk. Then, stir the warmed milk mixture back into the pot. For extra richness, you can also add another tablespoon of butter at this stage.
*   **Canned Bean Shortcut**: To save time, you can use one 15 oz (425g) can of Great Northern or cannellini beans. Simply rinse and drain them, skip the "Prepare the Beans" section, and add them to the soup along with the chicken stock.
*   **Canned Chicken Variation**: For an even quicker soup, you can substitute one 12.5 oz (355g) can of cooked chicken breast. If you do, you can skip the "Slice and season the chicken" and "Sear the chicken" steps. Drain the chicken and add it to the soup for the final 10-15 minutes of simmering. Note that this will change the final flavor, as you will miss the depth developed from searing fresh chicken.
