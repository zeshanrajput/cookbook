### Yield

6 to 8 servings (about 960ml)

### Prep Time

10 min

### Inactive Time

4 hr

### Cook Time

10 min

### Ingredients

*   1080ml whole milk, divided
*   200g sugar
*   40g cornstarch
*   3g kosher salt
*   5 large egg yolks, beaten
*   10ml vanilla extract

### Directions

1.  Heat 960ml of the milk in a large saucepan over medium heat until steaming. Whisk the sugar, cornstarch, and 3g salt in a large bowl. Whisk in the egg yolks and the remaining 120ml milk.
2.  Whisk half of the hot milk into the egg mixture until smooth, then gradually whisk the egg-milk mixture into the saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture boils. Continue to cook, whisking constantly, until it has thickened to a pudding-like consistency, 3 to 4 minutes.
3.  Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Cool slightly, stirring a few times to prevent a skin from forming. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding and refrigerate until completely cooled and thickened, about 4 hours.
4.  Before serving, whisk the pudding vigorously until smooth and creamy.

### Stir-ins (optional)

*   **Cookies and Cream**: Crush 20 chocolate wafer cookies, stir some into the pudding and top with the rest.
*   **Fresh Berries and Gingersnaps**: Fold in 2 cups (approx. 280g) of fresh, mixed berries and top with about 12 finely crushed gingersnaps.
*   **Vanilla-Banana**: Fold in 3 sliced bananas. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Fold in 24 crushed vanilla wafer cookies and top with more sliced bananas.
*   **Rocky Road**: Fold in 1 cup (approx. 100g) each mini marshmallows and toasted chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup (approx. 50g) of mini chocolate chips. Sprinkle with more chocolate chips.
*   **Peanut Butter and Jelly**: Fold in 1 cup (approx. 140g) quartered red grapes and 1/3 cup (approx. 50g) each chopped roasted peanuts and peanut butter chips. Top with whole grapes.

**Cook's Note**: Some people have allergies to peanuts, and if serving to guests, please make them aware of the inclusion of this peanut product.

## Chocolate Chip Cookies

### Ingredients

#### Wet Ingredients
*   227g (16 tbsp) unsalted butter, cut into tablespoons
*   28g (2 tbsp) heavy cream, half-and-half, or whole milk
*   100g (2 large) eggs, cold from the refrigerator
*   1 tbsp vanilla extract

#### Dry Ingredients
*   260g (2 cups) all-purpose flour
*   150g (3/4 cup packed) dark brown sugar
*   150g (3/4 cup) granulated sugar
*   6g (2 tsp) Diamond Crystal kosher salt
*   6g (1 tsp) baking soda

#### Chocolate
*   142g (5 ounces) bittersweet chocolate disks, half coarsely chopped
*   142g (5 ounces) milk chocolate disks, half coarsely chopped

### Instructions

1.  **Brown the Butter**: Melt the butter in a saucepan over moderate heat. Continuously scrape the bottom and stir to prevent milk solids from sticking and burning. Moderate the heat to keep it on the lower side to avoid burning. Continue cooking until the butter passes golden brown and reaches a very dark, but not burned, color. You'll see fine foam and brown bits at the bottom.
2.  **Cool the Butter Mixture**: Immediately remove the browned butter from the heat. Add 2 tablespoons of cold heavy cream (or half-and-half/whole milk) to the hot butter. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and let it cool. Stir the mixture frequently while it cools to ensure it remains homogeneous and doesn't separate. It should become opaque and smooth.
3.  **Mix the Batter**: Once the butter mixture has cooled, whisk in the dark brown sugar and granulated sugar until smooth and homogeneous. Do not cream until light and fluffy, as you don't want a lot of air in the batter. Add the cold large eggs, one at a time, whisking well after each addition until fully incorporated and the mixture takes on a silkier appearance. Whisk in the vanilla extract.
4.  **Combine Dry Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and kosher salt.
5.  **Prepare the Chocolate**: Coarsely chop half of both the bittersweet and milk chocolate disks. Keep the other half whole. This creates different sizes of chocolate in the cookie.
6.  **Finish the Dough**: Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and whisk until just combined. If the butter was solid, you might need to switch to a spatula. Fold in both the chopped and whole chocolate pieces, ensuring to include any chocolate dust from chopping.
7.  **Portion and Chill the Dough**: Using a 2-ounce scoop or ¼ cup measure, portion the dough onto baking sheets. You can place them close together as they will be chilled. Optionally, press an extra chocolate disk on top of each portion for a more photogenic look. Cover the baking sheet and chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours, and up to 48 hours. For longer storage (up to 3 days), transfer to the freezer. Chilling allows the butter to solidify, sugar to recrystallize, and flavors to develop, resulting in a chewier, more flavorful cookie.
8.  **Bake the Cookies**: Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F). Arrange six portions of dough on a baking sheet, spacing them out as they will spread. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Look for a golden brown edge and a pale, slightly shiny interior.
9.  **Cool and Serve**: Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for about 5 minutes, as they are delicate when hot. Transfer them to a wire rack to finish cooling. Enjoy the cookies, which will have a crispy edge and a gooey, warm center.
