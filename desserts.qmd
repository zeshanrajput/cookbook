## The "Everything Batter" (1:1:1 Ratio)

This recipe replaces several single-use batters with one memorable ratio, using the reliable "reverse creaming" method for a consistently tender crumb. It can be adapted to make cakes, Yorkshire puddings, crepes, and waffles.

### The Core Ratio (by Weight)
*   **1 part Egg**
*   **1 part Liquid** (e.g., milk)
*   **1 part Flour**

:::{.callout-note}
**The Reverse Creaming Method**: Unlike traditional methods that cream butter and sugar first, reverse creaming starts with the dry ingredients and blends in fat *before* adding liquids. By coating the flour in fat, we inhibit gluten development, resulting in a finer, more tender, velvety texture that is less prone to "tunneling" or toughness.

### Base Recipe: Everyday Cake / Yorkshire Pudding Batter

This default configuration is perfect for a simple, tender cake or can be used for savory Yorkshire puddings.

**Yields**: One 8-inch cake or ~12 Yorkshire puddings
**Prep time**: 10 minutes

#### Ingredients (by Weight for Precision)
*   100g All-Purpose Flour
*   100g Granulated Sugar (*Omit for savory Yorkshire Puddings*)
*   4g Baking Powder (1 tsp)
*   2g Salt (a generous pinch)
*   50g Unsalted Butter, softened to room temperature
*   100g Large Eggs (approx. 2 eggs), room temperature
*   100g Whole Milk, room temperature
*   5ml Vanilla Extract

#### Instructions (Reverse Creaming)
1.  **Combine Dry Ingredients**: In the bowl of a stand mixer (or a large bowl with a hand mixer), whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
2.  **Add Fat**: Add the softened butter to the dry ingredients. Mix on low speed until the mixture resembles coarse, damp sand and all the flour is coated.
3.  **Combine Wet Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and vanilla extract until just combined.
4.  **Finish the Batter**: Pour half of the wet ingredients into the flour-butter mixture and mix on low-medium speed until incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then add the remaining wet ingredients. Mix for another 20-30 seconds until the batter is smooth. Do not overmix.
5.  **For Cake**: Pour into a greased and floured 8-inch round cake pan. Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
6.  **For Yorkshire Puddings**: See variation below.

#### Chef's Notes
*   **Internal Temperature**: For the cake variation, if you are using an instant-read thermometer, pull the cake when it reaches **200°F (93°C)**. There will be a few degrees of "carry-over" cooking as it cools in the pan.

### Variations

#### 1. For Savory Yorkshire Puddings
*   **Modification**: Use the **Base Recipe** but **omit the sugar and vanilla**.
*   **Method**:
    1.  Place 1 tsp of beef drippings or neutral oil in each cup of a 12-cup muffin tin.
    2.  Preheat the oven with the tin inside to 425°F (220°C) until the fat is smoking hot.
    3.  Carefully pour the batter evenly into the hot-fat-filled cups.
    4.  Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until puffed, golden, and crisp. **Do not open the oven door** for the first 15 minutes.

#### 2. For Thin Crepes
*   **Modification**:
    *   Use the **Base Recipe** but **omit the baking powder**.
    *   **Double the milk** to 200g.
*   **Method**:
    1.  Mix the batter as described in the base recipe. The result will be very thin.
    2.  Rest the batter in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
    3.  Heat a lightly buttered non-stick skillet over medium heat.
    4.  Pour about 60ml (1/4 cup) of batter into the pan, swirling to create a thin, even layer.
    5.  Cook for 1-2 minutes per side, until lightly golden.

#### 3. For Crispy Waffles
*   **Modification**:
    *   **Increase flour** to 150g.
    *   **Increase butter** to 75g.
    *   (Optional, for extra crispiness): Separate the eggs. Add the yolks to the wet ingredients. Whip the egg whites to stiff peaks and fold them into the finished batter at the very end.
*   **Method**:
    1.  Mix the batter using the reverse creaming method.
    2.  If using whipped egg whites, fold them in gently.
    3.  Cook according to your waffle iron's manufacturer instructions.

## "The Baker's Secret" Chocolate Chip Cookies

This recipe is the result of a deep-dive into the chemistry of the perfect chocolate chip cookie, designed to deliver "bakery quality" results with high reliability for the home cook. It replaces the high-risk, high-reward brown butter technique with a series of "hacks" that use specific ingredients to mimic the same complex flavors and textures.

By using melted butter for chewiness, nonfat milk powder for "brown butter" flavor, cornstarch for softness, and an extra egg yolk for richness, this recipe builds a superior cookie without the technical difficulty.

**Yield**: 16–18 Large Cookies
**Prep Time**: 15 Minutes
**Chill Time**: 30 Minutes
**Bake Time**: 10–12 Minutes

### Ingredients

#### Wet Ingredients
*   170g (12 tbsp) Unsalted Butter
*   240g (1 1/4 cups) Granulated Sugar
*   10g (1/2 tbsp) Molasses
*   1 Large Egg (cold)
*   1 Large Egg Yolk (cold)
*   15ml (1 tbsp) Vanilla Extract

#### Dry Ingredients
*   280g (2 1/4 cups) All-Purpose Flour
*   6g (2 tsp) Cornstarch
*   15g (2 tbsp) Nonfat Milk Powder
*   4g (3/4 tsp) Baking Soda
*   4g (3/4 tsp) Salt
*   1g (1/2 tsp) Espresso Powder (Optional)

#### Mix-ins
*   250g (1 1/2 cups) Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips

::: {.callout-tip}
* Weighing ingredients (grams) is highly recommended for consistency. If using cups, be sure to spoon the flour into the cup and level it off, do not pack it.
* Measuring molasses is a pain. If you're comfortable eyeball it, or use the brown sugar & white sugar combination in the notes.
:::

### Instructions

1.  **Melt Butter & Dissolve Sugar**: Cut the butter into chunks and melt in a microwave-safe bowl (approx 45-60 seconds) or a saucepan. Immediately pour the warm butter over the Granulated Sugar in a large bowl. Whisk vigorously for 60 seconds. The mixture should look glossy, like wet sand.
2.  **Emulsify**: Add the molasses, cold egg, cold egg yolk, and vanilla extract. Whisk briskly for another 30-45 seconds until the mixture lightens slightly and thickens.
3.  **Combine Dry Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, whisk together the Flour, Cornstarch, Milk Powder, Baking Soda, Salt, and optional Espresso Powder.
4.  **Fold**: Add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture. Switch to a rubber spatula and gently fold until just a few streaks of flour remain. Do not overmix.
5.  **Add Chocolate**: Add the chocolate chips and fold until just combined and no flour streaks are visible.
6.  **Chill (Critical Step)**: Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. This step is non-negotiable; it allows the flour to hydrate and the fat to firm up, preventing the cookies from spreading into greasy puddles. (**Nadia**: clean the kitchen while you're waiting.)
7.  **Preheat & Prep**: While the dough chills, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
8.  **Shape**: Scoop dough into 3-tablespoon mounds (large golf ball size). For thicker cookies, roll the dough balls to be slightly taller than they are wide. Space them about 2 inches apart on the prepared sheets.
9.  **Bake**: Bake for 10–12 minutes. The edges should be set and golden brown, but the centers should still look soft and slightly under-baked.
10. **Cool**: Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack. The residual heat will finish cooking the centers to a perfect fudgy consistency.

### Chef's Notes: The Science Behind the Secrets

*   **The "Maillard Hack" (Milk Powder)**: Brown butter gets its nutty flavor from toasted milk solids. By adding nonfat milk powder to the flour, we supercharge the dough with these solids, creating deep toffee and butterscotch notes *inside* the cookie as it bakes—no stovetop required.
*   **The "Softness Insurance" (Cornstarch)**: Cornstarch interferes with gluten development, creating a "short," tender texture. It ensures the center of the cookie remains soft and pliable, acting as insurance against accidental over-baking.
*   **The "Shiny Top" Technique (Hot Dissolve)**: Whisking the sugar into the warm melted butter helps dissolve the sugar crystals. In the oven, this dissolved sugar forms a thin, meringue-like crust on the surface of the cookie that creates a coveted shiny, crackly finish.
*   **The "Fudgy" Emulsifier (Extra Egg Yolk)**: The extra yolk adds richness and fat, but more importantly, its lecithin content helps emulsify the melted butter into the dough. This prevents a greasy texture and leads to a denser, fudgy cookie.
*   **Using Brown Sugar**: For a more classic flavor profile, you can use brown sugar. Replace the 240g of granulated sugar and 10g of molasses with **150g (3/4 cup packed) of dark brown sugar** and **100g (1/2 cup) of granulated sugar**. The recipe will work identically otherwise.
*   **Why Chocolate Chips?**: This recipe defaults to chips because they contain stabilizers that help them hold their shape. This is critical for preventing the "greasy puddle" effect, especially since we are using melted butter.
*   **Pro-Tip: Using Chopped Chocolate**: If you prefer the luxurious "puddles" of chopped bars, you **must** make two adjustments to avoid greasy, flat cookies:
    1.  Reduce the amount to **200g**.
    2.  **Sieve the chopped chocolate** to remove the fine dust. The dust melts directly into the dough, increasing the fat content and causing the cookies to fry and spread. Only add the chunks.
*   **Peanut Butter Chips**: Heretical, but I like the substitution. Toss the chips in a little flour before adding them if you can. 


### Troubleshooting

*   **My cookies came out flat and greasy.**
    *   **Diagnosis**: The fat was too liquid when it went into the oven.
    *   **Fix**: Ensure you chilled the dough for the full 30 minutes (or longer if your kitchen is warm). Also, make sure you measured your flour correctly (preferably by weight).
*   **My cookies are too cakey.**
    *   **Diagnosis**: Too much flour or too much egg white.
    *   **Fix**: Weigh your flour to ensure accuracy. Double-check that you used one *whole egg* and one *egg yolk*, not two whole eggs. The extra egg white adds water, which creates steam and a cake-like texture.
*   **Can I skip the milk powder?**
    *   **Answer**: Yes, the cookies will still work structurally, but they will taste like standard homemade cookies. You will lose the "bakery-style" toffee and nutty background flavors that make this recipe special.

## Scientific Rough Puff Pastry (The American Strategy)

Attribution: A technical synthesis of [Paul Hollywood](https://www.paulhollywood.com/), [Gordon Ramsay](https://www.gordonramsay.com/), and [Claire Saffitz](https://www.youtube.com/c/ClaireSaffitzxDessertPerson).

::: {.callout-note}
**The "Lipid State" Strategy**: This recipe reconciles British techniques with the American kitchen. It uses **Frozen Butter** (Hollywood's hack) to keep the fat discrete in hot American kitchens, and **All-Purpose Flour** (Saffitz's adjustment) for tenderness. By controlling the thermodynamic state of the butter, we achieve a lift comparable to full puff pastry with a fraction of the effort.
:::

**Yield**: Approx. 1kg of dough (Generous amount for 1 Deep-Dish Double Crust Pie or 2 Galettes).
**Prep Time**: 30 Minutes (active).
**Rest Time**: 2 Hours.

### Ingredients

#### The Structure
*   450g (3 3/4 cups) All-Purpose Flour (spooned & leveled)
*   9g (1.5 tsp) Fine Sea Salt (or 9g [which is NOT 1.5tsp] Kosher Salt)

#### The Lipids
See Chef's Notes for information on choosing a butter.

*   **75g (5 tbsp)** Unsalted Butter, **Chilled** (40°F / 4°C)
*   **300g (2.5 sticks)** Unsalted Butter, **Frozen Solid** (min. 2 hours)

#### The Hydration
*   165ml (approx 2/3 cup + 1 tbsp) Ice Cold Water
*   15ml (1 tbsp) Apple Cider Vinegar (essential for inhibiting gluten snap-back)

### Instructions

#### 1. The "Sand" Phase (Shortening the Dough)
1.  **Whisk**: In a large metal bowl (pre-chilled if your kitchen is hot), whisk the flour and salt.
2.  **Rub**: Cut the **75g of chilled butter** into cubes. Rub it into the flour using your fingertips until the mixture creates a texture like coarse sand.
    *   *Why?* This coats some flour particles in fat, limiting gluten development appropriately for a tender bite (The "Hollywood" Shortcrust Base).
    *   *Tech Shortcut*: You can pulse the flour, salt, and chilled butter in a **food processor** (5-7 pulses) to achieve this texture instantly. Transfer to a bowl before proceeding to hydration.

#### 2. The Hydration (The "Shaggy Mass")
1.  **Combine Liquids**: Mix the vinegar into the ice water.
2.  **Hydrate**: Drizzle the liquid over the flour mixture while fluffing constantly with a fork.
3.  **The "Squeeze Test"**: Stop mixing when the dough looks dry and shaggy but holds together when squeezed firmly in your hand. **Do not over-hydrate**. If it looks like smooth cookie dough, it is too wet. You *probably won't use* all the water. Claire starts with a half cup of water and adds more as needed. She also brings the dough together, lifts out pieces that are holding together, and then brings the rest of the dough together.
4.  **Initial Rest**: Gather the shaggy mass into a loose ball, wrap tightly in plastic, and **refrigerate for 2 hours**.
    *   *Why?* This allows passive hydration (autolyse) without mechanical kneading, preventing toughness.

#### 3. The Lamination (The Frozen Grate)
1.  **Roll**: On a floured surface (or marble slab), roll the dough into a rectangle approx 12x6 inches.
2.  **Turn 1**: Take your **Frozen Butter** and a box grater. Grate **1/3 of the frozen butter** directly onto the bottom 2/3 of the dough sheet. Fold the top (unbuttered) third down, and the bottom (buttered) third up over it (like a letter).
    *   *Tech Shortcut*: If your food processor has a **grating disk/attachment**, use it! Process the entire frozen block at once. Keep the grated butter in the freezer and sprinkle 1/3 of the pile by hand for each turn. This is superior to hand-grating as it prevents body heat transfer.
3.  **Turn 2**: Rotate the dough 90 degrees. Roll out again to 12x6. Grate/Sprinkle the **next 1/3 of frozen butter**. Fold.
4.  **Turn 3**: Rotate 90 degrees. Roll out. Grate/Sprinkle the **final 1/3 of frozen butter**. Fold.

#### 4. The Refinement (The "Shatter" Turns)
1.  **Integrate**: Perform 2-3 more "blind" turns (roll and fold *without* adding more butter).
    *   *Why?* This creates the "shattered glass" effect favored by Gordon Ramsay, breaking the butter strands into thousands of micro-layers.
2.  **Final Chill**: Wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using.

### Chef's Notes & Troubleshooting

*   **Europe vs. America**: American butter has more water (16-18%) than European (14%). **We have reduced the water in this recipe to 110ml to compensate.** If you use European butter (Kerrygold/Plugra), you may need to add that 10ml back to get the dough to come together.
*   **The "Graying" Prevention**: The vinegar isn't just for gluten relaxation; it lowers the pH to prevent the flour from oxidizing and turning gray in the fridge over time.
*   **Troubleshooting - Shrinkage**: If your pastry shrinks significantly in the oven, it wasn't rested enough (gluten tension) or was hydrated too much. Ensure the 2-hour rest is respected.
*   **Troubleshooting - "Pool of Butter"**: If butter leaks out during baking, your oven was likely too cool. Puff pastry needs a "thermal shock" of **400°F+ (200°C+)** to turn water to steam *before* the butter melts out.

## Julia Child's Fluffy Pumpkin Pie

Attribution: Based on [Julia Child’s Fluffy Pumpkin Pie Review](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/julia-child-fluffy-pumpkin-pie-review-8403744) from Simply Recipes.

### Yield

Two 9-inch pies (Serves 16)

### Ingredients

*   2 prepared pie crusts (unbaked), chilled
*   820g (29 oz) pumpkin purée (2 x 15oz cans or 1 x 29oz can)
*   200g (1 cup) granulated sugar
*   220g (1 cup packed) light brown sugar
*   240ml (1 cup) heavy cream
*   180ml (3/4 cup) whole milk
*   5 large egg yolks
*   45ml (3 tbsp) molasses
*   45ml (3 tbsp) spiced rum or bourbon
*   8g (3 tsp) ground cinnamon
*   5g (3 tsp) ground ginger
*   6g (1 tsp) salt
*   0.5g (1/4 tsp) ground nutmeg
*   0.5g (1/4 tsp) ground cloves
*   5 large egg whites

### Instructions

1.  **Preheat**: Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 450°F (230°C). Lightly grease two 9-inch pie pans.
2.  **Prepare Crust**: Line the two pie pans with the pie dough, trimming and crimping the edges. The edge should extend about 1/2 inch above the pan. Refrigerate while making the filling.
3.  **Make Filling Base**: In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin purée, granulated sugar, brown sugar, heavy cream, milk, egg yolks, molasses, rum (or bourbon), cinnamon, ginger, salt, nutmeg, and cloves until well mixed.
4.  **Whip Egg Whites**: In a stand mixer with the whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), beat the egg whites on medium-low speed until foamy. Increase speed and beat until stiff peaks form. Do not over-beat.
5.  **Fold**: Add a quarter of the egg whites to the pumpkin mixture and mix to lighten it. Carefully fold in the remaining egg whites until just combined.
6.  **Bake**: Immediately divide the filling between the two prepared pie pans and smooth the tops. Place in the oven and bake for 15 minutes at 450°F (230°C).
7.  **Reduce Heat**: Without opening the oven, reduce the temperature to 375°F (190°C) and bake for another 15 minutes.
8.  **Reduce Heat Again**: Reduce the temperature to 350°F (175°C) and bake for a final 15 minutes. Check for doneness: a thin skewer inserted two inches from the edge should come out clean. If not, bake in 5-minute increments.
9.  **Cool**: Turn off the oven, prop the door open slightly with a wooden spoon, and let the pies cool slowly in the oven for 30 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack to finish cooling. Serve slightly warm or chilled.

**Chef's Notes**:

*   This recipe relies on the initial high oven temperature (450°F) to set the bottom crust, so parbaking is not required. Ensure your pie dough is well-chilled before baking to prevent shrinking.
*   The original recipe calls for 4 egg yolks and 5 egg whites; I have adjusted this to 5 yolks to avoid a leftover yolk and add richness.

## Americanized "Old School" Sheet Cake

This recipe captures the nostalgia of classic school dinners with a simple, robust sheet cake and the iconic "Pink Custard" made without specialty powders.

### Ingredients

#### For the Cake
*   240g (2 cups) All-Purpose Flour (spooned and leveled if using volume measurements)
*   12g (3 tsp) Baking Powder
*   3g (1/2 tsp) Salt
*   227g (1 cup / 2 sticks) Unsalted Butter, softened
*   200g (1 cup) Granulated Sugar
*   4 Large Eggs, room temperature
*   10ml (2 tsp) Vanilla Extract
*   45ml (3 tbsp) Whole Milk

#### For the Thick White Icing
*   300g (2 1/2 cups) Powdered Sugar (Confectioners' Sugar)
*   45–60ml (3–4 tbsp) Warm Water
*   Rainbow Sprinkles (jimmies or nonpareils)

#### For the Homemade "Pink Custard"
*   480ml (2 cups) Whole Milk
*   38g (3 tbsp) Sugar
*   16g (2 tbsp) Cornstarch (Cornflour)
*   5ml (1 tsp) Vanilla Extract
*   1 drop Red or Pink food coloring

### Instructions

#### The Cake
1.  **Prep**: Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13-inch metal baking pan. For easy removal, line the bottom with parchment paper.
2.  **The "DIY Self-Rising" Mix**: In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. This ensures the leavening is evenly distributed so your cake doesn't have "craters."
3.  **Creaming**: In a large bowl, cream the softened butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy (about 3 minutes with a hand mixer).
4.  **Combine**: Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each. Stir in the vanilla.
5.  **Fold**: Gradually add the flour mixture. Once combined, stir in the milk to reach a smooth, "dropping" consistency.
6.  **Bake**: Spread into the pan and bake for 25–30 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean. Cool completely in the pan.

#### The Icing
1.  **Mix**: Whisk the powdered sugar and warm water (start with 45ml/3 tbsp, add more if needed) until it’s the consistency of thick toothpaste.
2.  **Decorate**: Pour over the completely cooled cake and spread with an offset spatula. Add sprinkles immediately before the icing sets.

#### The Pink Custard
1.  **The Slurry**: In a small cup, mix the cornstarch with 45ml (3 tbsp) of the cold milk until it’s a smooth liquid with no lumps.
2.  **Heat**: Pour the rest of the milk and the sugar into a saucepan. Heat over medium until it just starts to simmer (steaming, with small bubbles at the edges).
3.  **Thicken**: Pour the cornstarch slurry into the hot milk while whisking constantly.
4.  **Finish**: Continue to cook for 1–2 minutes as it thickens. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla and food coloring. It will thicken further as it sits!

### Chef's Notes

*   **Internal Temperature**: If you are using an instant-read thermometer, pull the cake when it reaches **200°F (93°C)**. There will be a few degrees of "carry-over" cooking as it cools in the pan, which will bring it to the perfect final temperature (205°F (96°C)) without drying it out.

## The Food Charlatan's Snickerdoodles

Attribution: [My Favorite Snickerdoodles](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/my-favorite-snickerdoodles/) by Karen from The Food Charlatan.

These are widely considered the quintessential Snickerdoodles: pillowy soft, tangy from the cream of tartar, and coated in a generous layer of cinnamon sugar. They have that classic "cracked earth" look and a texture that stays soft for days.

### Yields
2–3 Dozen Cookies

### Prep Time
20 Minutes

### Bake Time
8–10 Minutes

### Ingredients

#### For the Dough
*   350g (2 3/4 cups) All-Purpose Flour (spooned and leveled)
*   8g (2 tsp) Cream of Tartar
*   6g (1 tsp) Baking Soda
*   3g (1/2 tsp) Salt
*   227g (1 cup / 2 sticks) Unsalted Butter, softened
*   300g (1 1/2 cups) Granulated Sugar
*   2 Large Eggs
*   10ml (2 tsp) Vanilla Extract

#### For the Cinnamon-Sugar Coating
*   67g (1/3 cup) Granulated Sugar
*   15g (2 tbsp) Ground Cinnamon

### Instructions

1.  **Prep**: Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.
2.  **Dry Mix**: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3.  **Cream**: In a large bowl (or stand mixer), cream the softened butter and 300g (1 1/2 cups) sugar together until light and fluffy (about 2–3 minutes).
4.  **Wet Mix**: Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each. Stir in the vanilla.
5.  **Combine**: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture. Mix until just combined. The dough will be thick.
6.  **Make Coating**: In a small bowl, whisk together the coating sugar and cinnamon.
7.  **Shape**: Scoop the dough into 1.5-tablespoon balls. Roll each ball generously in the cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat completely.
8.  **Bake**: Place balls 2 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 8–10 minutes.
    *   *Visual Cue*: They should look set and puffy, but still soft in the center. The edges should be barely golden.
9.  **Cool**: Let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. They will deflate slightly and develop their signature crackled surface as they cool.

### Chef's Notes

*   **Cream of Tartar**: This is essential for the signature tangy flavor and chewy texture. If you absolutely cannot find it, you can replace *both* the cream of tartar (2 tsp) and the baking soda (1 tsp) with **3 teaspoons (12g) of baking powder**. *Warning*: The result will be slightly cakier and lack the classic Snickerdoodle tang, but you'll have a decent cinnamon-sugar cookie.
*   **Don't Overbake**: These cookies rely on being slightly underbaked to maintain their softness. If they look wet, bake a minute longer. If they look dry, you've gone too far.
*   **Internal Temperature**: If you are technically inclined, you can pull these when the internal temperature registers between **175°F - 180°F (79°C - 82°C)**. They will finish setting as they cool.
