### Yield

6 to 8 servings (about 960ml)

### Prep Time

10 min

### Inactive Time

4 hr

### Cook Time

10 min

### Ingredients

*   1080ml whole milk, divided
*   200g sugar
*   40g cornstarch
*   3g kosher salt
*   5 large egg yolks, beaten
*   10ml vanilla extract

### Directions

1.  Heat 960ml of the milk in a large saucepan over medium heat until steaming. Whisk the sugar, cornstarch, and 3g salt in a large bowl. Whisk in the egg yolks and the remaining 120ml milk.
2.  Whisk half of the hot milk into the egg mixture until smooth, then gradually whisk the egg-milk mixture into the saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture boils. Continue to cook, whisking constantly, until it has thickened to a pudding-like consistency, 3 to 4 minutes.
3.  Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla. Cool slightly, stirring a few times to prevent a skin from forming. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding and refrigerate until completely cooled and thickened, about 4 hours.
4.  Before serving, whisk the pudding vigorously until smooth and creamy.

### Stir-ins (optional)

*   **Cookies and Cream**: Crush 20 chocolate wafer cookies, stir some into the pudding and top with the rest.
*   **Fresh Berries and Gingersnaps**: Fold in 2 cups (approx. 280g) of fresh, mixed berries and top with about 12 finely crushed gingersnaps.
*   **Vanilla-Banana**: Fold in 3 sliced bananas. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Fold in 24 crushed vanilla wafer cookies and top with more sliced bananas.
*   **Rocky Road**: Fold in 1 cup (approx. 100g) each mini marshmallows and toasted chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup (approx. 50g) of mini chocolate chips. Sprinkle with more chocolate chips.
*   **Peanut Butter and Jelly**: Fold in 1 cup (approx. 140g) quartered red grapes and 1/3 cup (approx. 50g) each chopped roasted peanuts and peanut butter chips. Top with whole grapes.

**Cook's Note**: Some people have allergies to peanuts, and if serving to guests, please make them aware of the inclusion of this peanut product.
