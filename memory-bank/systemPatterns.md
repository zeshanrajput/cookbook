# System Patterns

## Content Organization

The cookbook's content is organized by **Meal Type**. This structure was chosen for its intuitive and traditional approach to recipe categorization.

The primary chapters are:

- `index.qmd`
- `breakfast.qmd`
- `sauces_marinades.qmd`
- `main_courses.qmd`
- `side_dishes.qmd`
- `desserts.qmd`
- `drinks.qmd`

The bibliography file is `references.bib`.

## Recipe Formatting

*   **Metric Conversion**: Where possible, all imperial measurements in recipes should be converted to metric. Values can be rounded to make measurements easier, as long as it doesn't substantially change the recipe.
*   **Notification**: When performing these conversions, I will inform you of the changes I am making.
*   **Spice Measurement**: All spices should be measured in grams.

## Ingredient Subsection Strategy

To improve the readability and consistency of recipes, the ingredients list should be broken down into logical subsections where appropriate.

Common subsections include:

*   `#### Spices`
*   `#### Garnishes`
*   `#### For the Sauce`
*   `#### For the Marinade`
*   `#### For the Dough`
*   `#### For the Topping`
*   `#### For Brushing`
