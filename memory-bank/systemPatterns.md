# System Patterns

## Content Organization

The cookbook's content is organized by **Meal Type**. This structure was chosen for its intuitive and traditional approach to recipe categorization.

A new chapter for `Sauces & Marinades` was added to house recipes that are not full meals themselves.

The primary chapters are:

- `index.qmd`: The landing page/cover of the book.
- `intro.qmd`: An introduction to the cookbook.
- `breakfast.qmd`: Recipes for breakfast.
- `appetizers.qmd`: Recipes for appetizers and snacks.
- `soups_salads.qmd`: Recipes for soups and salads.
- `sauces_marinades.qmd`: Recipes for sauces and marinades.
- `main_courses.qmd`: Recipes for main courses.
- `side_dishes.qmd`: Recipes for side dishes.
- `desserts.qmd`: Recipes for desserts.
- `drinks.qmd`: Recipes for drinks.
- `summary.qmd`: A concluding summary.
- `references.qmd`: A section for references or citations.

## Recipe Formatting

*   **Metric Conversion**: Where possible, all imperial measurements in recipes should be converted to metric. Values can be rounded to make measurements easier, as long as it doesn't substantially change the recipe.
*   **Notification**: When performing these conversions, I will inform you of the changes I am making.
*   **Spice Measurement**: All spices should be measured in grams.
