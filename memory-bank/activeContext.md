# Active Context

## Project Philosophy

This cookbook is a "living document." It is expected to be in a constant state of refinement, with new recipes being added, existing ones improved, and notes taken on an ongoing basis. The project is never truly "done."

## Current Focus

Adding more recipes to the Quarto cookbook.

## Next Steps

## Key Decisions

- The cookbook is organized by meal type.
- Recipes are converted to metric, with dry spices in grams.
