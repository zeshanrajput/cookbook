# Recipe Progress

This file tracks the maturity of each recipe based on how many times it has been made.

## Bread
- [ ] The Everything Dough Recipe (Made many times. Now my recipe for most basic breads. I don't make the NYT recipe anymore. I do make the pizza crust recipe when making pizza, as the flavor profile is better.)
- [ ] Homemade Naan (Modified) (Made several times. My go-to recipe though not significantly better than store-bought yet.)
- [ ] Jay's Signature Pizza Crust (Made many times.)
- [ ] Basic White Sandwich Bread (Made several times, though not better than store bought bread unless you're on a boat and away from land for a while.)
- [ ] NYT No Knead Bread Recipe (Made several times. I use this baking technique with the simpler everything dough recipe above.)

## Breakfast
- [ ] Good Old-Fashioned Pancakes (Modified) (Made many times.)
- [ ] Quarter Sheet Pan Egg Roulade (Made several times.)
- [ ] Quarter Sheet-Pan Omelette (Made several times.)
- [ ] Kansai-Style Quarter Sheet Pan Tamagoyaki (Made 1. Didn't like the flavor profile. Needs significant work to make the sweeter tamago style instead.)
- [ ] The Perfect British-Style Scone for the American Kitchen (Made many, many times. Now a staple to have in the freezer.)

## Desserts
- [ ] 1-2-3-4 Cake (Made several times. My go-to cake.)
- [ ] Vanilla Pudding (Made several times. Not signifcantly better than store-bought.)

## Drinks
- [ ] Boardwalk Lemonade (Made many times. Now a go-to for homemade lemonade.)
- [ ] Pumpkin Spice Latte (Made: 0)

## Main Courses
- [ ] Karachi Chicken Karahi (Made many, many times. Recipe is near final. While not everyone's favorite karahi, this is a dish my family and friends love.)
- [ ] Okonomiyaki (Made many times. A family favorite.)
- [ ] Baotze (Chinese Steamed Buns) (Made several times. Hard work, but always enjoyed. Great party dinner/event.)
- [ ] Instant Pot Butter Chicken (Modified) (Made several times. Great recipe.)
- [ ] Mini Man Burgers with Grilled Onions (Modified) (Made several times. Great recipe, but cleanup is rough. Now prefer the recipe below.)
- [ ] The Best Cheeseburger Sliders You’ll Ever Make (Made several times. Great recipe, not quite as flavorful as mini-man burgers but good compromise for easier cleanup.)
- [ ] Dal Makhani (Made once or twice. Went well.)

## Soups & Stews
- [ ] My take on a "medieval" stew (Made a few times. Want to work on getting a more 'stew' and less 'soup' consistency.)
- [ ] Cha Cha's White Chicken Chili (Modified) (Made many times. Great to have in the soup/stew rotation.)
- [ ] Easy Butter Chicken Soup (Made: 0)

## Sauces & Marinades
- [ ] Korean BBQ Marinade for Chicken Thighs (Made a few times, very well received. Great recipe for large crowds).
