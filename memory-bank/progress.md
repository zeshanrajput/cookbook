# Recipe Progress

This file tracks the maturity of each recipe based on how many times it has been made.

## Bread
- [ ] The Everything Dough Recipe (Made many times. Now my recipe for most basic breads. I don't make the NYT recipe anymore. I do make the pizza crust recipe when making pizza, as the flavor profile is better.)
- [ ] Homemade Naan (Modified) (Made several times. Reworked with a "Cast Iron Inversion" technique and hybrid leavening to better simulate a tandoor. Untested.)
- [ ] Jay's Signature Pizza Crust (Made many times.)
- [ ] Basic White Sandwich Bread (Made several times, though not better than store bought bread unless you're on a boat and away from land for a while.)
- [ ] NYT No Knead Bread Recipe (Made several times. I use this baking technique with the simpler everything dough recipe above.)
- [ ] The "Considered Average" Shokupan (Made: 0)

## Breakfast
- [ ] Good Old-Fashioned Pancakes (Modified v2) (Made many times. Reworked to sour the milk and include a resting phase for a more tender and taller pancake. Untested.)

## Desserts
- [ ] "The Baker's Secret" Chocolate Chip Cookies (Made: 0. New recipe designed for high-yield, low-risk, using chemical mimicry to create bakery-style results. Replaces the previous brown-butter recipe. Untested.)
- [ ] The "Everything Batter" (1:1:1 Ratio) (Made: 0. Replaces the old 1-2-3-4 cake with a versatile ratio-based batter using the reverse creaming method. Can be used for cakes, crepes, waffles, and Yorkshire puddings. Untested.)
