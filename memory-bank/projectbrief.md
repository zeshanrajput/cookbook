# Project Brief: Personal Recipe Cookbook

## 1. High-Level Goal

The primary goal is to create a personal digital cookbook using Quarto.

## 2. Scope

- The project will contain a collection of personal recipes.
- The initial structure and organization need to be defined.
- The output will be a Quarto book.

## 3. Success Criteria

A successfully rendered Quarto book containing the user's recipes, organized in a logical and user-friendly manner.

## 4. Project Philosophy

This cookbook is a "living document." It is expected to be in a constant state of refinement, with new recipes being added, existing ones improved, and notes taken on an ongoing basis. The project is never truly "done."
