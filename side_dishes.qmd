Attribution: Based on [Boston Baked Beans](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/18255/boston-baked-beans/) from Allrecipes.

### Ingredients

*   400g dry beans (navy, kidney, black, or whatever you have)
*   1 medium onion, diced

#### For the Sauce

*   120ml ketchup
*   45ml molasses
*   50g brown sugar
*   15ml Worcestershire sauce
*   12g salt
*   1g ground black pepper
*   5ml prepared yellow mustard or 15ml prepared Dijon mustard (instead of dry mustard)
*   3g smoked paprika

### Instructions

1.  **Soak the beans**: Soak the dry beans in water overnight.
2.  **Boil the beans**: Transfer the soaked beans and their soaking water to a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 1 to 2 hours until the beans are nearly tender. Drain the beans and reserve the cooking liquid.
3.  **Combine ingredients**: Preheat the oven to 165°C (325°F). Layer the cooked beans and the diced onion in a 2-quart (approx. 1.9-liter) casserole dish.
4.  **Make the sauce**: In a separate saucepan, combine the ketchup, molasses, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, your chosen mustard substitute, and the smoked paprika over medium heat. Bring to a boil.
5.  **Assemble and bake**: Pour the sauce over the beans in the casserole dish. Add enough reserved cooking liquid to just cover the beans.
6.  **Bake the beans**: Cover the casserole dish and bake for 1.5 hours. Then, remove the lid and continue to cook for another 1.5 to 2.5 hours, or until the beans are soft and tender. Add more cooking liquid every half hour if the beans start to get too dry.
7.  Serve hot.

**Note:** For a spicier version, you can substitute Kashmiri red pepper for the smoked paprika.

## Sushi Rice

A basic recipe for seasoned rice, perfect for sushi or rice bowls.

### Ingredients

*   200g uncooked short-grain white rice (yields about 400-600g of cooked rice)

#### For the Seasoning:

*   45-60ml rice vinegar
*   30g sugar
*   5g salt

### Instructions

1.  Cook the rice according to your preferred method (rice cooker, pot, etc.).
2.  While the rice is cooking, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl or saucepan.
3.  Heat the mixture gently over low heat, stirring until the sugar and salt are completely dissolved. Do not bring it to a boil.
4.  Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large, non-metallic bowl while it is still hot.
5.  Gently pour the warm vinegar mixture over the rice.
6.  Use a rice paddle or a large spoon to "cut" and fold the seasoning into the rice. The motion should be a slicing and lifting one, not a stirring one, to avoid mashing the grains. The goal is to coat each grain evenly.
7.  Let the rice cool to room temperature before using it for sushi. You can cover the bowl with a damp cloth to prevent the rice from drying out.
