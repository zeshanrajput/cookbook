## Good Old-Fashioned Pancakes (Modified v2)

Attribution: Based on [Good Old-Fashioned Pancakes](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21014/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/) from Allrecipes.

### Ingredients

*   300ml milk
*   15ml white vinegar
*   180g all-purpose flour
*   14g baking powder
*   13g white sugar
*   45ml butter, melted
*   1 large egg

### Directions

1.  **Sour the milk:** In a measuring cup, combine the milk and white vinegar. Let it stand for 5 minutes. This will create a buttermilk-like mixture that makes the pancakes more tender.
2.  **Mix dry ingredients:** While the milk is souring, sift the flour, baking powder, and sugar together in a large bowl.
3.  **Combine wet and dry:** Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the soured milk, melted butter, and egg. Mix until just smooth. Do not overmix; a few lumps are okay.
4.  **Rest the batter:** Let the batter rest for 10-15 minutes. This allows the flour to hydrate and the gluten to relax, resulting in a taller, fluffier pancake.
5.  **Cook the pancakes:** Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 60ml (1/4 cup) for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes.
6.  **Flip and serve:** Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve and enjoy!

## Quarter Sheet Pan Egg Roulade

Yields: 4-6 servings
Prep time: 15 minutes
Cook time: 20-30 minutes (total)

### Ingredients:

**For the Egg Base:**

*   4 large eggs
*   30ml milk or cream
*   Salt and pepper to taste
*   Optional flavorings: herbs (chives, parsley, dill), grated cheese, spices (nutmeg, paprika)

**For the Filling (choose one or a combination of these pork-free options):**

*   Cooked and crumbled turkey sausage or beef sausage
*   Shredded or diced chicken
*   Shredded cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, Gruyere, goat cheese)
*   Sautéed vegetables (spinach, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers)
*   Smoked salmon or other cured fish
*   Fresh herbs (basil, cilantro)
*   Cream cheese or other spreadable cheese
*   Roasted red peppers, chopped
*   Sun-dried tomatoes, chopped

**For Rolling:**

*   Parchment paper
*   Cooking spray or butter for greasing

### Equipment:

*   A 23x33cm rimmed baking pan
*   Large mixing bowl
*   Whisk
*   Rubber spatula
*   Sharp knife

### Instructions:

**Prepare the Baking Pan:**

1.  Preheat your oven to 175°C.
2.  Lightly grease your 23x33cm baking pan with cooking spray or butter.
3.  Line the pan with a piece of parchment paper that overhangs the two long edges. The overhang is crucial for lifting and rolling the roulade. You can also lightly grease the parchment paper for extra insurance against sticking.

**Make the Egg Base:**

1.  In a large mixing bowl, whisk the 4 large eggs until they are light and slightly frothy.
2.  Whisk in the milk or cream until well combined.
3.  Season generously with salt and pepper.
4.  If desired, whisk in any optional flavorings like chopped herbs, grated cheese, or spices.

**Bake the Egg Base:**

1.  Pour the egg mixture evenly onto the prepared 23x33cm pan.
2.  Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the eggs are just set and no longer liquid in the center. The surface should be slightly spongy to the touch. Be very careful not to overbake, as this is the most common reason for cracking.

**Cool Slightly and Add Filling:**

1.  Remove the pan from the oven and let the egg sheet cool for about 5 minutes. This makes it easier to handle.
2.  Carefully loosen the edges of the egg sheet from the parchment paper using a thin spatula or knife.
3.  Evenly distribute your chosen filling ingredients over the surface, leaving a small border (about 1.25cm) along one of the long edges to help with rolling.

**Roll the Roulade:**

1.  Starting from one of the long edges, begin to gently roll the egg sheet up like a jelly roll. Use the parchment paper overhang to help you lift and guide the roll. Roll it tightly and evenly.
2.  Once fully rolled, position the roulade seam-side down on the baking sheet (still lined with parchment).

**Heat Through (Optional):**

1.  If you want to melt cheese or heat the filling, you can return the rolled roulade to the oven for another 5-10 minutes.

**Cool and Serve:**

1.  Let the roulade cool for a few minutes before slicing with a sharp knife. This will help it hold its shape and prevent the filling from oozing out.

## Quarter Sheet-Pan Omelette

### Adjusted Ingredients

*   **Large Eggs**: 12
*   **Milk**: 120ml
*   **Shredded Cheese**: 120g
*   **Favorite Fillings**: 120-240g (see ideas below)
*   **Salt and Black Pepper**: To taste
*   **Cooking Spray or Butter**: For greasing the pan

#### Recommended Non-Pork Fillings (choose 120-240g total)

*   Cooked chicken sausage or turkey sausage: These are widely available and come in a variety of flavors, from mild to spicy.
*   Ground turkey or chicken: Cooked and seasoned with a little salt, pepper, and herbs like thyme or sage.
*   Shredded cooked chicken breast: A great way to use up leftovers.
*   Smoked turkey or beef sausage: Check the ingredients to ensure they are pork-free.

#### Vegetarian fillings: The most straightforward and flavorful option.

*   Sautéed mushrooms and onions
*   Roasted red peppers and spinach
*   Diced tomatoes and fresh basil
*   Steamed broccoli florets and cheddar cheese
*   Diced potatoes, sautéed until tender
*   Black beans and corn (gives it a "Southwest" feel)

### Instructions

**Preheat Oven:**

1.  Preheat your oven to 175°C.

**Prepare the Pan:**

1.  Grease the 23x33cm baking pan generously with cooking spray or butter. For even easier cleanup, you can line it with parchment paper first and then grease the paper.

**Whisk the Eggs:**

1.  In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and milk together until they are well combined and slightly frothy. Season with salt and pepper.

**Add Your Fillings:**

1.  Stir in your chosen cooked fillings and about half of the shredded cheese into the egg mixture.

**Pour and Top:**

1.  Pour the egg mixture evenly into the prepared pan. Sprinkle the remaining cheese and any other toppings (like fresh herbs) over the top.

**Bake:**

1.  Carefully place the pan in the preheated oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the eggs are set and the top is lightly golden. The center should not be "jiggly."

**Cool and Serve:**

1.  Let the omelette cool in the pan for a few minutes before slicing it into squares. Serve hot, or store in the refrigerator for future breakfasts.

## Kanto-Style (Sweet) Quarter Sheet Pan Tamagoyaki (v2)

Yields: 4-6 servings
Prep time: 10 minutes
Cook time: 10-12 minutes

### A Note on Tamagoyaki Styles
This recipe is for a sweeter style of tamagoyaki, often found in the Kanto region of Japan (around Tokyo). This version incorporates a starch slurry and mayonnaise to ensure a soft, flexible texture that can be rolled without cracking, a common issue with the sheet pan method.

### Ingredients

#### For the Egg Base:
*   4 large eggs
*   1.25g powdered hondashi
*   60ml cold water
*   5g cornstarch (approx. 1 tsp)
*   15ml mayonnaise
*   15ml mirin
*   7.5ml soy sauce (light soy sauce, or *usukuchi shoyu*, is preferred for a lighter color)
*   110g sugar
*   A pinch of salt

#### For Rolling:
*   Parchment paper
*   Cooking spray or butter for greasing

### Chef's Note: Mirin Alternatives
Mirin is a sweet Japanese rice wine that adds a specific flavor and sweetness. If you don't have it, you can make a substitute:
*   **Good substitute:** For every 1 tablespoon of mirin, use 1 tablespoon of dry sherry or sweet marsala wine.
*   **Acceptable substitute:** For every 1 tablespoon of mirin, use 1 tablespoon of white wine or rice vinegar mixed with 1/2 teaspoon of sugar.

### Equipment:
*   A 23x33cm (9x13 in) rimmed baking pan
*   Large mixing bowl
*   Whisk
*   Rubber spatula
*   Sharp knife

### Instructions

#### Prepare the Baking Pan (HHST Protocol):
1.  **Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F).** This High-Heat, Short-Time (HHST) protocol is crucial.
2.  Lightly grease your quarter sheet pan with cooking spray or butter.
3.  Line the pan with a piece of parchment paper that overhangs the two long edges. This overhang will be crucial for lifting and rolling the egg sheet.

#### Make the Tamagoyaki Mixture:
1.  In a small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in the **cold** water, then whisk in the hondashi powder until fully combined. This creates a starch slurry.
2.  In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs until light and frothy.
3.  Add the mayonnaise, mirin, soy sauce, sugar, and salt to the eggs. Whisk until the sugar is dissolved.
4.  Gently whisk the dashi-cornstarch slurry into the egg mixture until just combined.

#### Bake the Egg Base:
1.  Pour the egg mixture evenly onto the prepared 23x33-cm pan.
2.  **Bake for 10-12 minutes**, or until the eggs are just set and the center is not "jiggly." The surface should be puffed and slightly golden. Do not overbake.

#### Roll and Slice:
1.  **Immediately** remove the pan from the oven. The egg must be rolled while still hot to prevent cracking.
2.  Using the parchment paper overhang as handles, lift the egg sheet out of the pan and place it on a heat-resistant surface.
3.  Starting from one of the long edges, begin to gently and tightly roll the egg sheet up like a jelly roll. Use the parchment paper to help guide and tighten the roll.
4.  Once fully rolled, wrap the tamagoyaki tightly in the parchment paper (like a tourniquet) to help it hold its cylindrical shape as it cools.
5.  Let it cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing into 2.5-cm thick pieces with a sharp knife.
