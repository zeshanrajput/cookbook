### Ingredients

*   180g all-purpose flour
*   14g baking powder
*   13g white sugar
*   300ml milk (plus more, as needed, for desired consistency)
*   45ml butter, melted
*   1 large egg

### Directions

1.  Gather all ingredients.
2.  Sift flour, baking powder, and sugar together in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth. Add additional milk, a little at a time, until the batter reaches a pourable consistency.
3.  Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 60ml (1/4 cup) for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes.
4.  Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
5.  Serve and enjoy!
