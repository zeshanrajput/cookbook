## Quarter Sheet Pan Egg Roulade

Yields: 4-6 servings
Prep time: 15 minutes
Cook time: 20-30 minutes (total)

### Ingredients:

**For the Egg Base:**

*   4 large eggs
*   30ml milk or cream
*   Salt and pepper to taste
*   Optional flavorings: herbs (chives, parsley, dill), grated cheese, spices (nutmeg, paprika)

**For the Filling (choose one or a combination of these pork-free options):**

*   Cooked and crumbled turkey sausage or beef sausage
*   Shredded or diced chicken
*   Shredded cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, Gruyere, goat cheese)
*   Sautéed vegetables (spinach, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers)
*   Smoked salmon or other cured fish
*   Fresh herbs (basil, cilantro)
*   Cream cheese or other spreadable cheese
*   Roasted red peppers, chopped
*   Sun-dried tomatoes, chopped

**For Rolling:**

*   Parchment paper
*   Cooking spray or butter for greasing

### Equipment:

*   A 23x33cm rimmed baking pan
*   Large mixing bowl
*   Whisk
*   Rubber spatula
*   Sharp knife

### Instructions:

**Prepare the Baking Pan:**

1.  Preheat your oven to 175°C.
2.  Lightly grease your 23x33cm baking pan with cooking spray or butter.
3.  Line the pan with a piece of parchment paper that overhangs the two long edges. The overhang is crucial for lifting and rolling the roulade. You can also lightly grease the parchment paper for extra insurance against sticking.

**Make the Egg Base:**

1.  In a large mixing bowl, whisk the 4 large eggs until they are light and slightly frothy.
2.  Whisk in the milk or cream until well combined.
3.  Season generously with salt and pepper.
4.  If desired, whisk in any optional flavorings like chopped herbs, grated cheese, or spices.

**Bake the Egg Base:**

1.  Pour the egg mixture evenly onto the prepared 23x33cm pan.
2.  Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the eggs are just set and no longer liquid in the center. The surface should be slightly spongy to the touch. Be very careful not to overbake, as this is the most common reason for cracking.

**Cool Slightly and Add Filling:**

1.  Remove the pan from the oven and let the egg sheet cool for about 5 minutes. This makes it easier to handle.
2.  Carefully loosen the edges of the egg sheet from the parchment paper using a thin spatula or knife.
3.  Evenly distribute your chosen filling ingredients over the surface, leaving a small border (about 1.25cm) along one of the long edges to help with rolling.

**Roll the Roulade:**

1.  Starting from one of the long edges, begin to gently roll the egg sheet up like a jelly roll. Use the parchment paper overhang to help you lift and guide the roll. Roll it tightly and evenly.
2.  Once fully rolled, position the roulade seam-side down on the baking sheet (still lined with parchment).

**Heat Through (Optional):**

1.  If you want to melt cheese or heat the filling, you can return the rolled roulade to the oven for another 5-10 minutes.

**Cool and Serve:**

1.  Let the roulade cool for a few minutes before slicing with a sharp knife. This will help it hold its shape and prevent the filling from oozing out.

### Instructions

**Preheat Oven:**

1.  Preheat your oven to 175°C.

**Prepare the Pan:**

1.  Grease the 23x33cm baking pan generously with cooking spray or butter. For even easier cleanup, you can line it with parchment paper first and then grease the paper.

**Whisk the Eggs:**

1.  In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and milk together until they are well combined and slightly frothy. Season with salt and pepper.

**Add Your Fillings:**

1.  Stir in your chosen cooked fillings and about half of the shredded cheese into the egg mixture.

**Pour and Top:**

1.  Pour the egg mixture evenly into the prepared pan. Sprinkle the remaining cheese and any other toppings (like fresh herbs) over the top.

**Bake:**

1.  Carefully place the pan in the preheated oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the eggs are set and the top is lightly golden. The center should not be "jiggly."

**Cool and Serve:**

1.  Let the omelette cool in the pan for a few minutes before slicing it into squares. Serve hot, or store in the refrigerator for future breakfasts.

## The Perfect British-Style Scone for the American Kitchen

There is a moment of pure, simple bliss that comes from breaking open a warm, freshly baked scone. Not the dense, sugar-laden triangles you might find at a coffee shop, but a true British scone—impossibly light, flaky, and buttery, with a golden top and a soft, tender crumb. It's a taste of tradition, a cornerstone of the classic "cream tea."

This recipe bridges the gap between the hallowed halls of British baking and the modern American kitchen. We’ll use ingredients that are easy to find, like all-purpose flour and buttermilk, and employ simple techniques to achieve that authentic, melt-in-your-mouth texture. Forget dry, heavy scones; these are lofty, elegant, and ready to be slathered with your favorite jam and a dollop of cream.

### The Four Secrets to a Perfect Scone

*   **Cold Ingredients are Non-Negotiable**: Your butter and liquids must be very cold. When small pieces of cold butter hit the hot oven, they release steam, creating tiny pockets of air that result in a light, flaky texture.
*   **A Gentle Hand is Key**: Overworking the dough develops gluten, which leads to tough, chewy scones. Mix until the ingredients are just combined. A shaggy, slightly sticky dough is a good sign.
*   **Pat, Don’t Roll**: While you can use a rolling pin, gently patting the dough to thickness with your hands prevents over-compacting it, keeping the final product tender.
*   **Cut Cleanly**: When cutting your rounds, press the cutter straight down and pull it straight up. Don't twist! Twisting the cutter seals the edges of the scone, preventing it from rising to its full, glorious height.

### The Recipe

**Yields**: 8-10 (2.5-inch) scones
**Prep time**: 15 minutes
**Bake time**: 12-15 minutes

### Ingredients

*   360g All-Purpose Flour, plus more for dusting
*   50g Granulated Sugar
*   12g Baking Powder
*   3g Salt
*   113g (8 tbsp / 1 stick) Unsalted Butter, very cold, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
*   1 large Egg
*   180ml Buttermilk, very cold (see Baker's Notes for substitutions)
*   1 large Egg, beaten with 15ml of milk or cream (for the egg wash)

### Equipment

*   Large mixing bowl
*   Pastry blender or two knives (or a food processor)
*   2.5-inch round biscuit or cookie cutter
*   Baking sheet lined with parchment paper
*   Pastry brush

### Instructions

1.  **Prepare Your Station**: Preheat your oven to 200°C (400F). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
2.  **Combine Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt.
3.  **Cut in the Butter**: Add the cold, cubed butter to the flour mixture. Using a pastry blender or your fingertips, quickly cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces of butter still visible. (For modern convenience, you can pulse the dry ingredients and butter in a food processor 8-10 times until the correct texture is reached. Then, transfer to a bowl.)
4.  **Mix the Wet Ingredients**: In a separate small bowl, whisk the egg and the cold buttermilk together until just combined.
5.  **Form the Dough**: Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients. Use a fork or a spatula to mix until a shaggy, slightly sticky dough begins to form. Do not overmix! It's okay if there are a few dry patches.
6.  **A Quick Knead**: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently and quickly knead the dough just 3-4 times to bring it together into a cohesive ball. It should still look a little rough.
7.  **Pat and Cut**: Gently pat the dough into a round that is about 3/4-inch to 1-inch thick. Using a 2.5-inch round cutter dipped in flour, press straight down to cut out your scones. Do not twist the cutter. Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet, about an inch apart. Gently bring the scraps together, pat down, and cut out more scones until all the dough is used.
8.  **The Finishing Touch**: Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the tops (but not the sides) of the scones with the egg wash. This will give them a beautiful, glossy golden-brown finish.
9.  **Bake**: Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the scones have risen high and are a lovely golden brown.
10. **Cool**: Transfer the scones to a wire rack to cool slightly. They are best served warm on the day they are made.

### Baker's Notes, Variations & Serving

*   **Buttermilk Substitute**: If you don't have buttermilk, you can make a quick version. Add 1 tablespoon (15ml) of lemon juice or white vinegar to a measuring cup, then add enough whole milk to reach the 3/4-cup (180ml) line. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes before using. Alternatively, you can use heavy cream for a richer, more decadent scone.
*   **Classic Fruit Scones**: For a traditional variation, gently fold 85g of dried currants or raisins into the dough just before you turn it out onto your work surface.
*   **Savory Cheese Scones**: For a savory treat, reduce the sugar to 1 tablespoon. Add 113g of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and a pinch of cayenne pepper to the dry ingredients before cutting in the butter.
*   **Freezing for Later**: You can freeze unbaked scones for future convenience. Cut them out, place them on a tray, and freeze until solid. Transfer to a freezer bag. They can be baked directly from frozen; just add 2-4 minutes to the baking time.
*   **How to Serve a Proper Scone**: A "Cream Tea" is the traditional way to enjoy scones. This involves serving them with clotted cream and strawberry or raspberry jam. As clotted cream can be hard to find in the U.S., here are some excellent alternatives:
    *   **Mock Clotted Cream**: Beat 1 cup (240ml) of cold heavy cream to stiff peaks. In a separate bowl, whisk 113g of mascarpone cheese with 8g of powdered sugar until smooth. Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone.
    *   **Lightly Sweetened Whipped Cream**: A simple and delicious option.
    *   **Crème Fraîche**: Offers a wonderful tangy richness.
