### Directions

1.  Gather all ingredients.

## Quarter Sheet Pan Egg Roulade

Yields: 4-6 servings
Prep time: 15 minutes
Cook time: 20-30 minutes (total)

### Ingredients:

**For the Egg Base:**

*   4 large eggs
*   30ml milk or cream
*   Salt and pepper to taste
*   Optional flavorings: herbs (chives, parsley, dill), grated cheese, spices (nutmeg, paprika)

**For the Filling (choose one or a combination of these pork-free options):**

*   Cooked and crumbled turkey sausage or beef sausage
*   Shredded or diced chicken
*   Shredded cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, Gruyere, goat cheese)
*   Sautéed vegetables (spinach, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers)
*   Smoked salmon or other cured fish
*   Fresh herbs (basil, cilantro)
*   Cream cheese or other spreadable cheese
*   Roasted red peppers, chopped
*   Sun-dried tomatoes, chopped

**For Rolling:**

*   Parchment paper
*   Cooking spray or butter for greasing

### Equipment:

*   A 23x33cm rimmed baking pan
*   Large mixing bowl
*   Whisk
*   Rubber spatula
*   Sharp knife

### Instructions:

**Prepare the Baking Pan:**

1.  Preheat your oven to 175°C.
2.  Lightly grease your 23x33cm baking pan with cooking spray or butter.
3.  Line the pan with a piece of parchment paper that overhangs the two long edges. The overhang is crucial for lifting and rolling the roulade. You can also lightly grease the parchment paper for extra insurance against sticking.

**Make the Egg Base:**

1.  In a large mixing bowl, whisk the 4 large eggs until they are light and slightly frothy.
2.  Whisk in the milk or cream until well combined.
3.  Season generously with salt and pepper.
4.  If desired, whisk in any optional flavorings like chopped herbs, grated cheese, or spices.

**Bake the Egg Base:**

1.  Pour the egg mixture evenly onto the prepared 23x33cm pan.
2.  Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the eggs are just set and no longer liquid in the center. The surface should be slightly spongy to the touch. Be very careful not to overbake, as this is the most common reason for cracking.

**Cool Slightly and Add Filling:**

1.  Remove the pan from the oven and let the egg sheet cool for about 5 minutes. This makes it easier to handle.
2.  Carefully loosen the edges of the egg sheet from the parchment paper using a thin spatula or knife.
3.  Evenly distribute your chosen filling ingredients over the surface, leaving a small border (about 1.25cm) along one of the long edges to help with rolling.

**Roll the Roulade:**

1.  Starting from one of the long edges, begin to gently roll the egg sheet up like a jelly roll. Use the parchment paper overhang to help you lift and guide the roll. Roll it tightly and evenly.
2.  Once fully rolled, position the roulade seam-side down on the baking sheet (still lined with parchment).

**Heat Through (Optional):**

1.  If you want to melt cheese or heat the filling, you can return the rolled roulade to the oven for another 5-10 minutes.

**Cool and Serve:**

1.  Let the roulade cool for a few minutes before slicing with a sharp knife. This will help it hold its shape and prevent the filling from oozing out.

## Quarter Sheet-Pan Omelette

### Adjusted Ingredients

*   **Large Eggs**: 12
*   **Milk**: 120ml
*   **Shredded Cheese**: 120g
*   **Favorite Fillings**: 120-240g (see ideas below)
*   **Salt and Black Pepper**: To taste
*   **Cooking Spray or Butter**: For greasing the pan

#### Recommended Non-Pork Fillings (choose 120-240g total)

*   Cooked chicken sausage or turkey sausage: These are widely available and come in a variety of flavors, from mild to spicy.
*   Ground turkey or chicken: Cooked and seasoned with a little salt, pepper, and herbs like thyme or sage.
*   Shredded cooked chicken breast: A great way to use up leftovers.
*   Smoked turkey or beef sausage: Check the ingredients to ensure they are pork-free.

#### Vegetarian fillings: The most straightforward and flavorful option.

*   Sautéed mushrooms and onions
*   Roasted red peppers and spinach
*   Diced tomatoes and fresh basil
*   Steamed broccoli florets and cheddar cheese
*   Diced potatoes, sautéed until tender
*   Black beans and corn (gives it a "Southwest" feel)

### Instructions

**Preheat Oven:**

1.  Preheat your oven to 175°C.

**Prepare the Pan:**

1.  Grease the 23x33cm baking pan generously with cooking spray or butter. For even easier cleanup, you can line it with parchment paper first and then grease the paper.

**Whisk the Eggs:**

1.  In a large bowl, whisk the eggs and milk together until they are well combined and slightly frothy. Season with salt and pepper.

**Add Your Fillings:**

1.  Stir in your chosen cooked fillings and about half of the shredded cheese into the egg mixture.

**Pour and Top:**

1.  Pour the egg mixture evenly into the prepared pan. Sprinkle the remaining cheese and any other toppings (like fresh herbs) over the top.

**Bake:**

1.  Carefully place the pan in the preheated oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the eggs are set and the top is lightly golden. The center should not be "jiggly."

**Cool and Serve:**

1.  Let the omelette cool in the pan for a few minutes before slicing it into squares. Serve hot, or store in the refrigerator for future breakfasts.

#### Prepare the Baking Pan:

1.  Preheat your oven to 175°C.

3.  Line the pan with a piece of parchment paper that overhangs the two long edges. This overhang will be crucial for lifting and rolling the egg sheet.

#### Make the Tamagoyaki Mixture:

1.  In a small bowl, dissolve the 1.25g of powdered hondashi in the 60ml of hot water. Stir until completely dissolved.
2.  In a large mixing bowl, whisk the eggs until they are light and frothy.

1.  Pour the egg mixture evenly onto the prepared 23x33-cm pan.
2.  Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the eggs are just set and the center is not "jiggly." The surface should be slightly spongy to the touch. Be careful not to overbake, as this will make it dry and prone to cracking.

#### Roll and Slice:

1.  Remove the pan from the oven and let the egg sheet cool for about 5 minutes.
2.  Starting from one of the long edges, begin to gently roll the egg sheet up like a jelly roll. Use the parchment paper overhang to help you lift and guide the roll. Roll it tightly and evenly.
3.  Let it cool for another few minutes before slicing into 2.5-cm thick pieces with a sharp knife.
