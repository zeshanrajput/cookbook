## Karachi Chicken Karahi

:::{.callout-note}
* Actual Karachi-style chicken karahi wouldn't use an onion. I do. We like the addition of the umami notes. You do you.
* This is a lot of oil. Evidently the oil separation (or "tarka") is a desired visual cue in a good karahi. Frying the tomato paste and masala before the chicken has helped absorb the oil, but a tarka is still present after the dish stands for a little. 
* This recipe is scaled to a can of tomato paste. This is because:
    * Tomato paste is already cooked, so you don't need as much time to develop the tomato flavor.
    * Chicken available in America has a lot more water than desi chicken. Using tomato paste instead of tomatoes or tomato sauce helps us keep the dish from getting watery.
    * This isn't a lot of tomato paste, but cooking it first gets the maximum amount of flavor from the one can. If you don't cook it first, you'll probably want a second or third can. 
    * The amount of oil and water is also approximately one 6oz can, so you can reuse the tomato paste can for a measure.
* For a charsi or Peshawari-style karahi omit the onion, tomato, and spices other than salt and pepper.

### Homemade Okonomi Sauce

This recipe makes enough sauce for one pancake with some extra. If you don't have oyster sauce, you can simply use a little extra soy sauce and a pinch of sugar.

*   15ml Soy sauce
*   15ml Honey or Sugar

Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and mix until smooth.

### Instructions

1.  In a large bowl, whisk together the Okonomiyaki Flour and Water until the mixture is smooth.
2.  Add the Egg, Cabbage, Onion, Tenkasu, Ginger, and any optional ingredients to the bowl and mix lightly. Be careful not to over-mix the batter.
3.  Heat a griddle or frying pan to 200°C (400°F) and oil it.
4.  Pour the entire okonomiyaki mixture onto the griddle, forming one pancake.
5.  Use a spatula to flatten and shape the pancake to a thickness of about 1.5cm (3/4").
6.  Place the Turkey Bacon pieces on top, covering the surface.
7.  After about 3 minutes, flip the pancake over so the bacon side is down and cook for 4 minutes.
8.  Flip the pancake again (bacon side up) and cook for another 3 minutes, or until it is firm and well browned.
9.  Remove the finished pancake to a plate and drizzle with Kewpie mayonnaise and your homemade Okonomi sauce. Sprinkle with Aonori and Katsuobushi.
10. Eat quickly while it's hot.

### Directions

1.  **Sauté and bloom the spices**: Set your Instant Pot to Sauté on normal heat. Add the tomato paste and a little bit of the warm water to create a slurry. Add the minced garlic, ginger, turmeric, cayenne, paprika, 4g of the cumin, and 0.5g of the allspice. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1-2 minutes until the spices are fragrant and the paste has deepened in color.

3.  Lock the lid into place. Select Manual or Pressure Cook and set the timer for 10 minutes on high pressure.
4.  When the cooking is complete, let the pressure release naturally. Carefully remove the chicken and set it aside.
5.  Using an immersion blender, blend the sauce until it is smooth. Let the sauce cool for a few minutes.
6.  Add the cubed butter, heavy cream (or your chosen substitute), the remaining 1g of cumin, and 0.5g of allspice. Stir until well incorporated. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
7.  Remove half of the sauce and freeze it for later, or refrigerate for up to 3 days.
8.  Add the chicken back to the pot, cut into bite-size pieces if desired. Set the Instant Pot to Sauté on low heat and let the chicken heat through.
9.  Serve warm.

## Mini Man Burgers with Grilled Onions (Modified)

Attribution: Based on [Mini Man Burgers with Grilled Onions](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/mini-man-burgers-with-grilled-onions-8131159) by Alton Brown from Food Network.

### Ingredients

*   1g garlic powder
*   1g freshly ground black pepper
*   14g kosher salt, divided
*   2 onions, finely chopped
*   450g ground meat (e.g., beef, turkey, chicken)
*   30ml yellow mustard, plus more for serving
*   Eight 7.5cm buns or rolls (e.g., Hawaiian rolls), split in half
*   8 dill pickle chips, ice cold, finely chopped
*   8 slices American cheese

### Directions

1.  Combine the garlic powder, black pepper, and 2g of kosher salt in a small bowl and set aside.
2.  Combine the onions and 12g of kosher salt in a bowl and set aside for 10 minutes. Strain and reserve the juices.
3.  Line a half sheet pan with parchment paper and place the ground meat in the middle of the pan. Cover the meat with a large sheet of plastic wrap and roll out the meat with a small rolling pin into a large rectangle that covers the surface of the pan; it will be very thin.
4.  Add a thin layer of yellow mustard and season the meat with the spice mixture. Pick up the edge of the parchment and fold the meat in half, widthwise. Roll a couple of times just to seal the two layers.
5.  Refrigerate for 10 minutes then cut into 8 even squares with a pizza cutter.
6.  Preheat a griddle pan over medium heat. Spread the onions out on the griddle in an even layer in a rectangular shape. Put the patties on top of the onions. Resist the urge to press them with your spatula. Squeezing burger patties is the culinary equivalent of picking at a scab, and you remember what your mom told you about that.
7.  Pour over some of the remaining onion juice to create steam. Top each patty with a slice of cheese and the bottom half of a bun. Cover the griddle with foil (but do not seal) and reduce the heat to low. Steam the burgers until cooked, 3 to 5 minutes.
8.  Construct burgers thusly: Add pickles and mustard to each bun top. Using a large spatula, pick up a burger-bottom bun stack and place it on the top half of a bun. Repeat with the remaining burger stacks and bun tops until there's nothing left to build. Consume mass quantities.

## Dal Makhani

### Ingredients

*   **Whole Black Lentils (Urad Dal)**: 200g
*   **Kidney Beans (Rajma)**: 50g
*   **Water**: 960-1200ml (for soaking and cooking)
*   **Salt**: To taste
*   **Butter or Ghee**: 30-45g (2-3 tbsp)
*   **Onion**: 1 medium, finely chopped
*   **Garlic**: 1-2 cloves, minced (just omit for garlic allergies)
*   **Ginger Paste**: 15g
*   **Tomato Paste**: 60g (approx. 2-3 tablespoons)
*   **Water**: 120ml (for blooming tomato paste)
*   **Cumin Powder**: 5g
*   **Allspice Powder**: 0.5g
*   **Red Chili Powder**: 1g (adjust to taste)
*   **Fresh Cream or Heavy Cream**: 120-240ml

### Preparation

**Soak the Lentils and Kidney Beans:**

1.  Rinse the urad dal and rajma thoroughly under cold water.
2.  Soak them together in at least 960ml of water overnight (8-12 hours). This is crucial for proper cooking and achieving the right texture.

**Cook the Lentils and Kidney Beans:**

1.  Drain the soaked lentils and kidney beans.
2.  Transfer them to a pot or pressure cooker with fresh water (enough to cover them by about 5cm). Add salt to taste.
3.  Cook until they are very soft and mushy. This will take longer than other lentils.
    *   **Stovetop**: Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 1-2 hours, or until the lentils and beans are completely tender and can be easily mashed. You may need to add more water during cooking.
    *   **Pressure Cooker**: Cook for 8-10 whistles on medium heat. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
    *   **Instant Pot**: Cook on high pressure for 30-40 minutes, followed by a natural pressure release for at least 15 minutes, then a manual release if needed.

**Prepare the Base Flavor:**

1.  Heat butter or ghee in a separate heavy-bottomed pan or or pot over medium heat.
2.  Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until they are golden brown (about 8-10 minutes).
3.  Add the tomato paste and 120ml of water. Cook, stirring constantly, for 3-5 minutes until the paste has deepened in color and the oil starts to separate.
4.  Add the ginger paste and sauté for another minute until fragrant.
5.  Stir in the cumin powder, allspice powder, and red chili powder. Sauté for about 30 seconds, stirring continuously.

**Combine Lentils and Base:**

1.  Pour the cooked lentils and kidney beans (along with the cooking liquid) into the pan with the tomato-onion base.
2.  Mix well and bring to a gentle simmer.

**Simmer and Cream:**

1.  Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan partially, and let the dal simmer for at least 30-45 minutes, or even longer if time permits. This slow simmering helps the flavors meld together and creates a creamy texture. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
2.  Stir in the fresh cream. Simmer for another 5-10 minutes. Adjust the consistency by adding more cream or a little water if needed. Check and adjust the salt.

**Garnish and Serve:**

1.  Garnish with thinly sliced fresh ginger juliennes and a squeeze of lemon juice at the end.
2.  Serve hot with naan, roti, paratha, or rice. A dollop of extra butter or cream on top is often added before serving for extra richness.

**Key to Dal Makhani's Richness:**

*   **Whole Black Lentils and Kidney Beans**: These specific lentils and beans contribute to the unique texture and flavor.
*   **Slow Cooking**: Long, slow simmering is essential for developing the rich and creamy consistency.
*   **Butter and Cream**: Generous use of butter (or ghee) and fresh cream is what gives Dal Makhani its signature luxuriousness.
