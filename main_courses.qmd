## My take on a "medieval" stew

As I understand it, innkeepers in medieval times would keep a pot on simmer. As people took a serving out of the pot, they would add whatever they had (meat, vegetables, etc.) to the stew. Because I have gout, I've made some notes to help lower purine. 

### Foundational Principles

Keep these in mind for gout-friendliness:

*   **Protein**: For low-purine options. Chicken (breast is best), turkey, or lean fish. Avoid organ meats, red meats, and shellfish.
*   **Thickener**: Use starches like flour, cornstarch, rice, or potatoes to thicken the stew.
*   **Flavor**: Rely on a base of vegetables, herbs, and spices rather than high-purine meat broths.

### 1. Building the Flavor Base (The Sauté)

This is the most important step for a rich, deep flavor. This is where you start your stew.

*   **Fats**: 15-30ml of olive oil.
*   **Aromatics**: Always start with these. Finely chop onions, shallots, or garlic. Sauté them until they are soft and translucent.
*   **"Long-Cooking" Vegetables**: These need a head start to become tender. Add these after the aromatics and sauté them for a few minutes.
    *   Carrots
    *   Celery
    *   Parsnips
    *   Turnips
    *   Hard squash (like butternut or pumpkin)

### 2. Adding the Protein and Spices

Once your flavor base is sautéed, it's time to bring in the main ingredients.

1.  **Protein**: Add your cubed chicken or turkey. Sauté it until it's lightly browned on all sides. This adds a great layer of flavor.
2.  **Dry Spices**: Add your spices now, such as paprika, cumin, oregano, black pepper, and a very small amount of cloves or cardamom. Sautéing the spices for about a minute will "bloom" them and release their full aroma.
3.  **Thickener (if using flour)**: Sprinkle about 30ml of flour over the ingredients. Stir constantly for 1-2 minutes until it coats everything and forms a paste.

### 3. The Simmering Stage

Now you add the liquid and the ingredients that need a long time to cook through.

1.  **Liquid**: Slowly pour in your unsalted broth or water, stirring to prevent any lumps from forming if you used flour. Add enough liquid to just barely cover the ingredients.
2.  **"Hard" Ingredients**: Add any ingredients that require a long cooking time to become tender and help thicken the stew.
    *   Potatoes (cut into large chunks)
    *   Rice (120ml is a good start)
    *   Bay leaves
3.  **Simmer**: Bring the stew to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cover the pot and let it cook for at least 30-45 minutes.

### 4. Finishing the Stew

Towards the end of the cooking process, add the ingredients that cook more quickly.

1.  **"Quick-Cooking" Vegetables**: These will become mushy if added too early. Add these 15-20 minutes before the stew is done.
    *   Bell peppers
    *   Cabbage
    *   Zucchini or summer squash
    *   Mushrooms
2.  **Remaining Thickener**: If you didn't use flour and the stew isn't as thick as you want, mix cornstarch with a little cold water to make a slurry. Stir it in and simmer until thickened.
3.  **Seasoning and Fresh Herbs**: Once the stew is ready, remove the bay leaves. Taste and add salt as needed. Stir in fresh herbs like chopped parsley or basil to add a bright flavor.

3.  Heat a griddle or frying pan to 200°C (400°F) and oil it.
4.  Pour the entire okonomiyaki mixture onto the griddle, forming one pancake.
5.  Use a spatula to flatten and shape the pancake to a thickness of about 1.5cm (3/4").
6.  Place the Turkey Bacon pieces on top, covering the surface.
7.  After about 3 minutes, flip the pancake over so the bacon side is down and cook for 4 minutes.

## Mini Man Burgers with Grilled Onions (Modified)

Attribution: Based on [Mini Man Burgers with Grilled Onions](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/mini-man-burgers-with-grilled-onions-8131159) by Alton Brown from Food Network.

### Ingredients

*   1g garlic powder
*   1g freshly ground black pepper
*   14g kosher salt, divided
*   2 onions, finely chopped
*   450g ground meat (e.g., beef, turkey, chicken)
*   30ml yellow mustard, plus more for serving
*   Eight 7.5cm buns or rolls (e.g., Hawaiian rolls), split in half
*   8 dill pickle chips, ice cold, finely chopped
*   8 slices American cheese

### Directions

1.  Combine the garlic powder, black pepper, and 2g of kosher salt in a small bowl and set aside.
2.  Combine the onions and 12g of kosher salt in a bowl and set aside for 10 minutes. Strain and reserve the juices.
3.  Line a half sheet pan with parchment paper and place the ground meat in the middle of the pan. Cover the meat with a large sheet of plastic wrap and roll out the meat with a small rolling pin into a large rectangle that covers the surface of the pan; it will be very thin.
4.  Add a thin layer of yellow mustard and season the meat with the spice mixture. Pick up the edge of the parchment and fold the meat in half, widthwise. Roll a couple of times just to seal the two layers.
5.  Refrigerate for 10 minutes then cut into 8 even squares with a pizza cutter.
6.  Preheat a griddle pan over medium heat. Spread the onions out on the griddle in an even layer in a rectangular shape. Put the patties on top of the onions. Resist the urge to press them with your spatula. Squeezing burger patties is the culinary equivalent of picking at a scab, and you remember what your mom told you about that.
7.  Pour over some of the remaining onion juice to create steam. Top each patty with a slice of cheese and the bottom half of a bun. Cover the griddle with foil (but do not seal) and reduce the heat to low. Steam the burgers until cooked, 3 to 5 minutes.
8.  Construct burgers thusly: Add pickles and mustard to each bun top. Using a large spatula, pick up a burger-bottom bun stack and place it on the top half of a bun. Repeat with the remaining burger stacks and bun tops until there's nothing left to build. Consume mass quantities.
