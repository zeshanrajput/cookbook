## My take on a "medieval" stew

As I understand it, innkeepers in medieval times would keep a pot on simmer. As people took a serving out of the pot, they would add whatever they had (meat, vegetables, etc.) to the stew. Because I have gout, I've made some notes to help lower purine. 

### Foundational Principles

Keep these in mind for gout-friendliness:

*   **Protein**: For low-purine options. Chicken (breast is best), turkey, or lean fish. Avoid organ meats, red meats, and shellfish.
*   **Thickener**: Use starches like flour, cornstarch, rice, or potatoes to thicken the stew.
*   **Flavor**: Rely on a base of vegetables, herbs, and spices rather than high-purine meat broths.

### 1. Building the Flavor Base (The Sauté)

This is the most important step for a rich, deep flavor. This is where you start your stew.

*   **Fats**: 15-30ml of olive oil.
*   **Aromatics**: Always start with these. Finely chop onions, shallots, or garlic. Sauté them until they are soft and translucent.
*   **"Long-Cooking" Vegetables**: These need a head start to become tender. Add these after the aromatics and sauté them for a few minutes.
    *   Carrots
    *   Celery
    *   Parsnips
    *   Turnips
    *   Hard squash (like butternut or pumpkin)

### 2. Adding the Protein and Spices

Once your flavor base is sautéed, it's time to bring in the main ingredients.

1.  **Protein**: Add your cubed chicken or turkey. Sauté it until it's lightly browned on all sides. This adds a great layer of flavor.
2.  **Dry Spices**: Add your spices now, such as paprika, cumin, oregano, black pepper, and a very small amount of cloves or cardamom. Sautéing the spices for about a minute will "bloom" them and release their full aroma.
3.  **Thickener (if using flour)**: Sprinkle about 30ml of flour over the ingredients. Stir constantly for 1-2 minutes until it coats everything and forms a paste.

### 3. The Simmering Stage

Now you add the liquid and the ingredients that need a long time to cook through.

1.  **Liquid**: Slowly pour in your unsalted broth or water, stirring to prevent any lumps from forming if you used flour. Add enough liquid to just barely cover the ingredients.
2.  **"Hard" Ingredients**: Add any ingredients that require a long cooking time to become tender and help thicken the stew.
    *   Potatoes (cut into large chunks)
    *   Rice (120ml is a good start)
    *   Bay leaves
3.  **Simmer**: Bring the stew to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cover the pot and let it cook for at least 30-45 minutes.

### 4. Finishing the Stew

Towards the end of the cooking process, add the ingredients that cook more quickly.

1.  **"Quick-Cooking" Vegetables**: These will become mushy if added too early. Add these 15-20 minutes before the stew is done.
    *   Bell peppers
    *   Cabbage
    *   Zucchini or summer squash
    *   Mushrooms
2.  **Remaining Thickener**: If you didn't use flour and the stew isn't as thick as you want, mix cornstarch with a little cold water to make a slurry. Stir it in and simmer until thickened.
3.  **Seasoning and Fresh Herbs**: Once the stew is ready, remove the bay leaves. Taste and add salt as needed. Stir in fresh herbs like chopped parsley or basil to add a bright flavor.

## Karachi Chicken Karahi

:::{.callout-note}
* Actual Karachi-style chicken karahi wouldn't use an onion. I do. We like the addition of the umami notes. You do you.
* This is a lot of oil. Evidently the oil separation (or "tarka") is a desired visual cue in a good karahi. We don't like it, so I'll probably cut the amount of oil in future versions, but this does make frying in a wok easier. 
* This recipe is scaled to a can of tomato paste. This is because:
    * Tomato paste is already cooked, so you don't need as much time to develop the tomato flavor.
    * Chicken available in America has a lot more water than desi chicken. Using tomato paste instead of tomatoes or tomato sauce helps us keep the dish from getting watery.
    * This isn't a lot of tomato paste, but cooking it first gets the maximum amount of flavor from the one can. If you don't cook it first, you'll probably want a second or third can. 
* To this end, I may cut the amount of water even further. It should be just enough to let everything stew together without burning. Admittedly I'm aiming for a dryer karahi, and I understand regional variations exist.
:::

### Ingredients

*   **Chicken**: 1.6 kg boneless chicken thighs
*   **Ghee or Oil**: 120ml
*   **Onion**: 1 medium onion, finely diced
*   **Tomato Paste**: 1 can (170g)
*   **Garlic**: 75ml, minced or crushed
*   **Ginger**: 75ml, minced or crushed (plus a small amount, julienned, for garnish)
*   **Water or Chicken Broth**: 120ml
*   **Green Chilies**: 6-8, slit lengthwise

#### Spices:

*   **Salt**: 12-18g
*   **Coriander Powder**: 6g
*   **Cumin Powder**: 7g total
*   **Red Chili Powder or Paprika**: 6-10g
*   **Black Peppercorns**: 7g, freshly crushed
*   **Allspice**: 1g *Note: Use at the end!*

#### Garnishes:

*   **Fresh Cilantro**: A generous handful, chopped
*   **Fresh Ginger**: A small amount, julienned

### Instructions

1.  **Sauté the Onion**: Heat the ghee or oil in a large wok or pot over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes until it is soft and translucent.
2.  **Bloom the Tomato Paste**: Add the tomato paste to the wok and stir it in with the onion. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the color deepens.
3.  **Add Aromatics**: Add the minced ginger and garlic. Cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
4.  **Fry the Chicken & Initial Spices**: Add the chicken pieces to the wok. Increase the heat to high. Add the coriander powder, 6g of cumin powder, red chili, and black pepper. Stir well and cook for 5-7 minutes until the chicken is browned and the spices are fragrant.
5.  **Simmer**: Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add 120ml of water or broth. Stir, then cover and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is tender. The sauce should be thick.
6.  **Final Touches**: Remove the lid and increase the heat to high. Cook and stir for a few minutes until the sauce thickens and the oil begins to separate from the masala. If there is an excessive amount of oil, you can carefully tip the wok and spoon some of it out.
7.  **Add Finishing Spices**: Turn off the heat. Stir in the green chilies, julienned fresh ginger, chopped cilantro, the remaining 1g of cumin, and the 1g of allspice.

## Mini Man Burgers with Grilled Onions (Modified)

Attribution: Based on [Mini Man Burgers with Grilled Onions](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/mini-man-burgers-with-grilled-onions-8131159) by Alton Brown from Food Network.

### Ingredients

*   1g garlic powder
*   1g freshly ground black pepper
*   14g kosher salt, divided
*   2 onions, finely chopped
*   450g ground meat (e.g., beef, turkey, chicken)
*   30ml yellow mustard, plus more for serving
*   Eight 7.5cm buns or rolls (e.g., Hawaiian rolls), split in half
*   8 dill pickle chips, ice cold, finely chopped
*   8 slices American cheese

### Directions

1.  Combine the garlic powder, black pepper, and 2g of kosher salt in a small bowl and set aside.
2.  Combine the onions and 12g of kosher salt in a bowl and set aside for 10 minutes. Strain and reserve the juices.
3.  Line a half sheet pan with parchment paper and place the ground meat in the middle of the pan. Cover the meat with a large sheet of plastic wrap and roll out the meat with a small rolling pin into a large rectangle that covers the surface of the pan; it will be very thin.
4.  Add a thin layer of yellow mustard and season the meat with the spice mixture. Pick up the edge of the parchment and fold the meat in half, widthwise. Roll a couple of times just to seal the two layers.
5.  Refrigerate for 10 minutes then cut into 8 even squares with a pizza cutter.
6.  Preheat a griddle pan over medium heat. Spread the onions out on the griddle in an even layer in a rectangular shape. Put the patties on top of the onions. Resist the urge to press them with your spatula. Squeezing burger patties is the culinary equivalent of picking at a scab, and you remember what your mom told you about that.
7.  Pour over some of the remaining onion juice to create steam. Top each patty with a slice of cheese and the bottom half of a bun. Cover the griddle with foil (but do not seal) and reduce the heat to low. Steam the burgers until cooked, 3 to 5 minutes.
8.  Construct burgers thusly: Add pickles and mustard to each bun top. Using a large spatula, pick up a burger-bottom bun stack and place it on the top half of a bun. Repeat with the remaining burger stacks and bun tops until there's nothing left to build. Consume mass quantities.

## Dal Makhani

### Ingredients

*   **Whole Black Lentils (Urad Dal)**: 200g
*   **Kidney Beans (Rajma)**: 50g
*   **Water**: 960-1200ml (for soaking and cooking)
*   **Salt**: To taste
*   **Butter or Ghee**: 30-45g
*   **Onion**: 1 medium, finely chopped
*   **Garlic**: 1-2 cloves, minced (just omit for garlic allergies)
*   **Ginger Paste**: 15g
*   **Tomato Paste**: 60g (approx. 2-3 tablespoons)
*   **Water**: 120ml (for blooming tomato paste)
*   **Cumin Powder**: 5g
*   **Allspice Powder**: 0.5g
*   **Red Chili Powder**: 1g (adjust to taste)
*   **Fresh Cream or Heavy Cream**: 120-240ml

### Preparation

**Soak the Lentils and Kidney Beans:**

1.  Rinse the urad dal and rajma thoroughly under cold water.
2.  Soak them together in at least 960ml of water overnight (8-12 hours). This is crucial for proper cooking and achieving the right texture.

**Cook the Lentils and Kidney Beans:**

1.  Drain the soaked lentils and kidney beans.
2.  Transfer them to a pot or pressure cooker with fresh water (enough to cover them by about 5cm). Add salt to taste.
3.  Cook until they are very soft and mushy. This will take longer than other lentils.
    *   **Stovetop**: Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 1-2 hours, or until the lentils and beans are completely tender and can be easily mashed. You may need to add more water during cooking.
    *   **Pressure Cooker**: Cook for 8-10 whistles on medium heat. Allow the pressure to release naturally.
    *   **Instant Pot**: Cook on high pressure for 30-40 minutes, followed by a natural pressure release for at least 15 minutes, then a manual release if needed.

**Prepare the Base Flavor:**

1.  Heat butter or ghee in a separate heavy-bottomed pan or or pot over medium heat.
2.  Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until they are golden brown (about 8-10 minutes).
3.  Add the tomato paste and 120ml of water. Cook, stirring constantly, for 3-5 minutes until the paste has deepened in color and the oil starts to separate.
4.  Add the ginger paste and sauté for another minute until fragrant.
5.  Stir in the cumin powder, allspice powder, and red chili powder. Sauté for about 30 seconds, stirring continuously.

**Combine Lentils and Base:**

1.  Pour the cooked lentils and kidney beans (along with the cooking liquid) into the pan with the tomato-onion base.
2.  Mix well and bring to a gentle simmer.

**Simmer and Cream:**

1.  Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan partially, and let the dal simmer for at least 30-45 minutes, or even longer if time permits. This slow simmering helps the flavors meld together and creates a creamy texture. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
2.  Stir in the fresh cream. Simmer for another 5-10 minutes. Adjust the consistency by adding more cream or a little water if needed. Check and adjust the salt.

**Garnish and Serve:**

1.  Garnish with thinly sliced fresh ginger juliennes and a squeeze of lemon juice at the end.
2.  Serve hot with naan, roti, paratha, or rice. A dollop of extra butter or cream on top is often added before serving for extra richness.

**Key to Dal Makhani's Richness:**

*   **Whole Black Lentils and Kidney Beans**: These specific lentils and beans contribute to the unique texture and flavor.
*   **Slow Cooking**: Long, slow simmering is essential for developing the rich and creamy consistency.
*   **Butter and Cream**: Generous use of butter (or ghee) and fresh cream is what gives Dal Makhani its signature luxuriousness.
