This recipe makes a vibrant and flavorful peri-peri chicken, perfect for grilling. It's designed for boneless, skinless chicken thighs, and features a unique blend of spices including dried jalapeño flakes, Kashmiri red pepper, and ginger.

*   **Yields**: 3.5 kg of chicken (approx. 7-10 chicken thighs)
*   **Prep time**: 20 minutes (plus 4-24 hours marination)
*   **Cook time**: 15-20 minutes per batch

### Ingredients

**For the Marinade:**

*   30-40 ml (approx. 20-25 g) dried jalapeño flakes (see note 1)
*   2-3 large red bell peppers
*   25-35 g minced garlic (see note 2)
*   150 ml rice wine vinegar (see note 3)
*   30-60 ml lemon juice (see note 7)
*   150 ml olive oil (or neutral oil)
*   10-12 g Kashmiri red pepper powder (see note 4)
*   3-4 g cayenne powder (see note 5 - adjust to taste)
*   8-10 g onion powder
*   8-10 g dried oregano
*   8-10 g salt (adjust to taste)
*   3-4 g black pepper
*   5-7 g sugar
*   8-10 g ginger paste (see note 6)
*   Medium handful of fresh cilantro or parsley (optional)

**For the Chicken:**

*   3.5 kg boneless, skinless chicken thighs

### Instructions

1.  **Prepare the Marinade:**
    *   *Prepare Dried Jalapeño Flakes*: If your dried jalapeño flakes are very coarse, you can give them a quick pulse in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. They do not typically require rehydration as they will soften in the marinade.
    *   Combine the dried jalapeño flakes, red bell peppers, minced garlic, rice wine vinegar, lemon juice, olive oil, Kashmiri red pepper powder, cayenne powder, onion powder, dried oregano, salt, black pepper, sugar, ginger paste, and optional fresh herbs in a blender or food processor (you may need to blend in batches depending on blender size).
    *   Blend until the mixture is completely smooth. You can use a small amount of water or the jalapeño soaking liquid (if you rehydrated whole dried jalapeños) if needed to achieve a smooth consistency.
    *   Taste the marinade and adjust seasonings (salt, sugar, and especially heat from cayenne) to your preference.
    *   Reserve about 1/4 of the marinade for basting during grilling and for serving with the cooked chicken. Do not use the reserved marinade on raw chicken to avoid cross-contamination.

2.  **Marinate the Chicken:**
    *   Trim any excess fat from the chicken thighs.
    *   Place the chicken thighs in several large resealable plastic bags or large shallow dishes (you will likely need multiple).
    *   Pour the main portion of the marinade over the chicken, ensuring each piece is thoroughly coated.
    *   Seal the bags or cover the dishes and refrigerate for a minimum of 4 hours, and ideally 8-24 hours for the best flavor penetration.

3.  **Barbecue the Chicken:**
    *   Take the chicken out of the refrigerator about 30 minutes before grilling to allow it to come to room temperature.
    *   Preheat your grill to a two-zone setup: one side on medium-high heat (direct heat) for searing, and the other side on low to medium heat (indirect heat) for cooking through. Lightly oil the grill grates.
    *   Place the chicken thighs on the direct heat side of the grill in batches to avoid crowding. Sear for 2-3 minutes per side to get a nice char.
    *   Move the chicken to the indirect heat side of the grill. Close the lid and continue to cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 74°C (165°F).
    *   During the last few minutes of cooking, you can baste the chicken with the reserved marinade for extra flavor.
    *   Once cooked, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before serving.

### Notes on Substitutions and Ingredients:

1.  **Dried Jalapeño Flakes**: We are assuming you have dried, crushed jalapeño flakes. If using whole dried jalapeños (which would be approximately 7-9 whole dried peppers for 3.5 kg of chicken), they should be rehydrated by soaking in boiling water for 20-30 minutes before blending. Fresh jalapeños can also be used, but the dried ones provide a more concentrated, smoky flavor.
2.  **Minced Garlic**: This is a direct substitution for garlic cloves. Approximately 1 teaspoon of minced garlic (5g) per medium clove.
3.  **Rice Wine Vinegar**: This was used as a substitute for sherry or red wine vinegar. It offers a milder, slightly sweeter acidity.
4.  **Kashmiri Red Pepper Powder**: Used for its vibrant color and mild, aromatic heat. If not available, regular paprika can be used, but the color may be less intense.
5.  **Cayenne Powder**: Used for adjustable heat. This is a potent spice, so start with a small amount and add more to taste. You can also use red pepper flakes if preferred, but cayenne provides a more uniform heat throughout the marinade.
6.  **Ginger Paste**: This was an addition for an extra layer of warmth, zest, and aromatic complexity. It pairs wonderfully with the other flavors.
7.  **Lemon Juice**: This measurement assumes the use of readymade lemon juice. If using fresh lemons, the yield can vary, but typically 1-2 lemons will provide approximately 30-60 ml of juice.

*   120ml water
*   25g brown sugar

*   5g (1 tsp) of butter
*   A splash of vanilla extract

### For the spice substitute

#### For the Pot

*   4g ground cinnamon
*   2g ground ginger
*   2g salt
*   4g ground nutmeg, divided
*   2g ground allspice or cloves

### Instructions

1.  Wash the apples and cut them into chunks, discarding the core. There's no need to peel them.
2.  With the instant pot on saute setting, melt the butter and add the cinnamon, ginger, 2g of the nutmeg, and allspice. Bloom for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
2.  Place the apple chunks into the Instant Pot. Add the water, brown sugar, salt, and vanilla extract to the spice mixture.
3.  Secure the lid on the Instant Pot and turn the vent to the SEAL position.
4.  Set the Instant Pot to the Manual/Pressure Cook setting for 15 minutes.
5.  When the cooking cycle is complete, allow the pressure to release naturally for 15 minutes. After this time, manually release any remaining pressure by turning the dial to the VENT position.
6.  Once the pressure is fully released, open the lid and stir in the lemon juice and another 2g of nutmeg.
7.  Use an immersion blender to puree the apples until the mixture is smooth. If you don't have an immersion blender, let the mixture cool for about 30 minutes, then transfer it to a regular blender and blend in small batches until smooth.
8.  Spoon the finished apple butter into jars or other containers. It can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 10 days or frozen for longer storage.
