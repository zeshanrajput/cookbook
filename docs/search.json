The overhang is crucial for lifting and rolling the roulade. You can also lightly grease the parchment paper for extra insurance against sticking.\n\nMake the Egg Base:\n\nIn a large mixing bowl, whisk the 4 large eggs until they are light and slightly frothy.\nWhisk in the milk or cream until well combined.\nSeason generously with salt and pepper.\nIf desired, whisk in any optional flavorings like chopped herbs, grated cheese, or spices.\n\nBake the Egg Base:\n\nPour the egg mixture evenly onto the prepared 23x33cm pan.\nBake for 10-15 minutes, or until the eggs are just set and no longer liquid in the center. The surface should be slightly spongy to the touch. Be very careful not to overbake, as this is the most common reason for cracking.\n\nCool Slightly and Add Filling:\n\nRemove the pan from the oven and let the egg sheet cool for about 5 minutes. This makes it easier to handle.\nCarefully loosen the edges of the egg sheet from the parchment paper using a thin spatula or knife.\nEvenly distribute your chosen filling ingredients over the surface, leaving a small border (about 1.25cm) along one of the long edges to help with rolling.\n\nRoll the Roulade:\n\nStarting from one of the long edges, begin to gently roll the egg sheet up like a jelly roll. Use the parchment paper overhang to help you lift and guide the roll. Roll it tightly and evenly.\nOnce fully rolled, position the roulade seam-side down on the baking sheet (still lined with parchment).\n\nHeat Through (Optional):\n\nIf you want to melt cheese or heat the filling, you can return the rolled roulade to the oven for another 5-10 minutes.\n\nCool and Serve:\n\nLet the roulade cool for a few minutes before slicing with a sharp knife. This will help it hold its shape and prevent the filling from oozing out.",

    "text": "2.2 Homemade Naan (Modified)\nAttribution: Based on the Homemade Naan recipe from Once Upon a Chef.\n\n2.2.1 Ingredients\n\n240-360g all-purpose flour\n13g sugar\n3g instant dry yeast/rapid-rise yeast\n6g salt\n45ml plain Greek yogurt\n30ml extra virgin olive oil\n180ml warm water (about 38°C / 100°F)\n\n\n2.2.1.1 For Brushing\n\n28g (2 tbsp) melted salted butter (for brushing on finished naans)\n3g dried parsley (optional)\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Instructions\n\nMix the dry ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt.\nMix the wet ingredients: In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the Greek yogurt, olive oil, and warm water.\nCombine and stir: Add the yogurt mixture to the dry ingredients and mix with a fork until the dough starts to come together.\nKnead: Dust your hands with flour and gently knead the dough, adding more flour as needed (up to an additional 120g), until it forms a soft, slightly sticky ball that pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Stop kneading as soon as it comes together.\nRise: Lightly oil a clean bowl, transfer the dough to it, and cover with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel. Let the dough rise in a warm place for 1 to 1½ hours, or until it has about doubled in size.\nPrep and divide: Dust a work surface with flour. Turn the risen dough onto the floured surface, shape it into a long rectangle, and cut it into six equal portions.\nHeat the skillet: Heat a large cast iron or heavy nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it is very hot.\nRoll and cook: While the skillet heats, roll one of the dough balls into an oval shape about ⅛-inch (3mm) thick. Gently place the dough in the hot, dry skillet. Cook until bubbles form and the bottom is browned in spots (a few minutes). Flip the naan and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the bottom is lightly browned and blistered.\nFinish and serve: Remove the naan from the skillet and brush with melted butter. Repeat with the remaining dough balls. Sprinkle with dried parsley, if desired, and serve warm.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Notes on Modifications\n\nAnise Seeds: The anise seeds were an optional ingredient in the original recipe, so they have been removed completely.\nGreek Yogurt: Greek yogurt is thicker than regular plain yogurt. The recipe uses the same amount, which should work fine.\nDried Parsley: Dried herbs are more potent than fresh ones. A general rule of thumb is to use one-third the amount of dried herbs as you would fresh. The original recipe called for 1 tablespoon of fresh parsley, so this recipe uses 1 teaspoon (now 3g) of dried parsley.\nFlour: Added up to 120g more flour to help the dough pull away from the bowl.",

Make sure the water is warm to the touch. If you can’t comfortably hold your finger in the water for several seconds, wait for it to cool. Pour the water into the bowl of a stand mixer or large bowl and sprinkle the yeast over top. Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.\nStart the dough. Place the milk, butter, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl and stir to combine. Transfer to the bowl with the yeast, add 120g of the flour, and stir until it forms a loose, lumpy batter.\nAdd the flour. Add 540g of the flour, reserving the remaining flour if the dough is sticky during kneading. Stir until a floury, shaggy dough is formed.\nKnead the dough. Using the dough hook attachment on a stand mixer on medium speed, knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes. (Alternatively, knead the dough by hand on the counter.) If the dough is bubble-gum sticky against the sides of the bowl or the counter, add extra flour a tablespoon at a time until it is no longer sticky. The dough is kneaded and ready when it is smooth, feels slightly tacky, forms a ball without sagging, and springs back when poked.\nDo the first rise. Remove the dough from the stand mixer bowl. Clean and dry the mixing bowl. Coat with a thin film of oil. Form the dough into a ball, place it in the bowl, and turn it to coat all over with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and let the rise in a warm spot until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.\nShape the dough. Sprinkle a little flour on a work surface and place the dough on top. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and shape each piece into a loose ball. Let the balls rest for 10 minutes.\nDo the second rise in the loaf pans. Grease 2 (20cm by 10cm) loaf pans with oil or coat them with cooking spray. Shape each ball of dough into a loaf (see Recipe Notes below for instructions or this tutorial for photos) and transfer to the loaf pans. It’s important that the surface of the loaves be stretched taut; this helps them rise evenly and keep its shape. If your loaf still seems a little loose after the initial folding, just fold it in half again and pinch it closed. We do this by pressing the middle down and drawing up the sides.\nHeat the oven to 220°C (425°F). Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven, remove any racks above it, and heat the oven to 220°C (425°F) about halfway through the second rise.\nSlash the loaves and bake. Using a serrated knife, make a long, shallow slash down the center of each loaf. Place them in the oven. Immediately turn down the heat to 190°C (375°F) and bake 30 to 35 minutes. Finished loaves will be dark golden-brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Remove the loaves from the pans onto wire racks and let cool completely before slicing.\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Recipe Notes\n\nStorage: Loaves wrapped in foil and plastic will keep at room temperature for several days or freeze for up to 3 months.\nHow to Form Loaves:\n\nFlatten into a rectangle. Use the heels of your hands to gently flatten the round into a rough rectangle. If the dough is sticking to the counter, sprinkle a little flour underneath. Try not to use too much flour, though, or else you’ll have trouble getting the dough to stick to itself once you shape.\nFold the bottom third up. This part is like folding a letter! Fold the bottom third of the dough over on itself.\nFold the top third down. Then fold the top of the dough down so that it overlaps the other layers.\nPinch closed. Use your fingers to pinch the dough closed where the top layer meets the bottom layers. Don’t forget the sides!\nFold the dough again. The goal is to get the surface of the loaf as taut as possible. This will help the loaf rise evenly and keep its shape. If your loaf still seems a little loose after the initial folding, just fold it in half again and pinch it closed. We do this by pressing the middle down and drawing up the sides.\nInvert the loaf into the pan. Roll the loaf over until the seam is facing down and then gently place the loaf into the pan. The seams should be on the bottom with the tight surface facing up.",

    "text": "2.5 The “Considered Average” Shokupan (Japanese Milk Bread)\nAttribution: Internal comparative analysis and formulation.\n\n2.5.1 Ingredients\n\n2.5.1.1 For the Tangzhong (Water Roux)\n\n25g (3 tbsp) All-Purpose Flour\n60ml (1/4 cup) Whole Milk\n60ml (1/4 cup) Water\n\n\n\n2.5.1.2 For the Main Dough\n\n325g (2 2/3 cups) All-Purpose Flour\n35g (2 1/2 tbsp) Granulated Sugar\n5g (1 1/2 tsp) Instant Yeast\n6g (1 tsp) Fine Sea Salt\n50g (1 large) Whole Egg, room temperature\n120ml (1/2 cup) Whole Milk, lukewarm\n30g (2 tbsp) Unsalted Butter, softened\n\n\n\n2.5.1.3 For Brushing (Optional)\n\n1 large Egg\n15ml (1 tbsp) Water or Milk\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Instructions\n\n2.5.2.1 Phase 1: The Tangzhong (Pre-Gelatinization)\n\nCombine: In a small saucepan, whisk the flour, milk, and water until smooth.\nHeat: Place over medium-low heat. Stir constantly with a whisk or silicone spatula.\nObservation: The mixture will first froth, then liquid will evaporate, and it will suddenly thicken into a paste.\nEndpoint: Cook until the whisk leaves lines in the mixture that do not immediately fill back in (approx 65°C / 149°F).\nCool: Transfer to the mixing bowl. Crucial: Let it cool to room temperature (or at least lukewarm). Adding yeast to hot Tangzhong will kill the yeast.\n\n\n\n2.5.2.2 Phase 2: Mixing and Autolyse\n\nLayer: In the bowl with the cooled Tangzhong, add the lukewarm milk, egg, sugar, and yeast. Whisk to break up the Tangzhong and dissolve the sugar.\nAdd Flour: Dump in the flour and salt.\nShaggy Mix: Mix on low speed (or by hand) just until no dry flour remains. It will look rough.\nRest (Autolyse): Cover the bowl and walk away for 20 minutes. This allows the flour to absorb the liquid fully and proteins to align naturally, reducing the need for mechanical kneading.\n\n\n\n2.5.2.3 Phase 3: Kneading and Fat Integration\n\nDevelop: After the rest, knead on medium-low speed for 5-7 minutes. The dough should smooth out.\nButter Addition: Add the softened butter in two batches. Wait for the first piece to disappear before adding the next.\nFinal Knead: Knead for another 5 minutes. The dough should be tacky (sticky to the touch) but not messy. It should pass the “Windowpane Test”—stretching translucent without tearing.\n\n\n\n2.5.2.4 Phase 4: Bulk Fermentation\n\nRise: Form into a ball. Place in a greased bowl and cover.\nEnvironment: Let rise for 1 to 1.5 hours at warm room temperature (24°C / 75°F).\nCue: Stop when the dough has just doubled. Do not let it triple, or the structure will collapse.\n\n\n\n2.5.2.5 Phase 5: Shaping (The 3-Fold Method)\n\nDivide: Punch down the dough gently. Weigh total dough (approx 650g) and divide into 3 equal pieces (~215g each).\nBench Rest: Round into balls. Cover and let rest for 15 minutes to relax the tension.\nLamination:\n\nTake one ball. Roll it out into a long oval (approx 8-10 inches).\nFold the right third into the middle. Fold the left third over that (like a letter).\nUse the rolling pin to flatten this strip slightly.\nRoll the strip up from the short end into a tight cylinder (swiss roll style).\n\nPan: Place the three cylinders into a greased 9x5 inch loaf pan, seam side down.\n\n\n\n2.5.2.6 Phase 6: Final Proof and Bake\n\nProof: Cover the pan. Let rise until the dough is about 1 inch below the rim of the pan (for a flat top) or just crowning the rim (for a domed top). This takes 45-60 minutes.\nBake: Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F). Brush the top with an egg wash (beaten egg with a splash of water) for shine if desired. Bake for 30-35 minutes.\nFinish: The bread is done when the internal temperature reads 88°C (190°F). Remove from pan immediately to a wire rack.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Chef’s Note: Dinner Rolls Variation\nThis dough makes excellent, fluffy dinner rolls.\n\nShaping: Divide the dough into 50-60g portions and roll into tight balls.\nPan Size: For a standard 9x13 inch baking pan, you will need to double the recipe. This will yield 20-24 rolls (arranged 4x5 or 4x6). A single batch fits well in a 9x9 inch square pan (9 large rolls).\nBaking: Proof until the rolls are puffy and touching. Bake at 175°C (350°F) for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 88°C (190°F).",

    "text": "2.7 The Perfect British-Style Scone for the American Kitchen\nThere is a moment of pure, simple bliss that comes from breaking open a warm, freshly baked scone. Not the dense, sugar-laden triangles you might find at a coffee shop, but a true British scone—impossibly light, flaky, and buttery, with a golden top and a soft, tender crumb. It’s a taste of tradition, a cornerstone of the classic “cream tea.”\nThis recipe bridges the gap between the hallowed halls of British baking and the modern American kitchen. We’ll use ingredients that are easy to find, like all-purpose flour and buttermilk, and employ simple techniques to achieve that authentic, melt-in-your-mouth texture. Forget dry, heavy scones; these are lofty, elegant, and ready to be slathered with your favorite jam and a dollop of cream.\n\n2.7.1 The Four Secrets to a Perfect Scone\n\nCold Ingredients are Non-Negotiable: Your butter and liquids must be very cold. When small pieces of cold butter hit the hot oven, they release steam, creating tiny pockets of air that result in a light, flaky texture.\nA Gentle Hand is Key: Overworking the dough develops gluten, which leads to tough, chewy scones. Mix until the ingredients are just combined. A shaggy, slightly sticky dough is a good sign.\nPat, Don’t Roll: While you can use a rolling pin, gently patting the dough to thickness with your hands prevents over-compacting it, keeping the final product tender.\nCut Cleanly: When cutting your rounds, press the cutter straight down and pull it straight up. Don’t twist! Twisting the cutter seals the edges of the scone, preventing it from rising to its full, glorious height.\n\n\n\n2.7.2 The Recipe\nYields: 8-10 (2.5-inch) scones Prep time: 15 minutes Bake time: 12-15 minutes\n\n\n2.7.3 Ingredients\n\n360g All-Purpose Flour, plus more for dusting\n50g Granulated Sugar\n12g Baking Powder\n3g Salt\n113g (8 tbsp / 1 stick) Unsalted Butter, very cold, cut into 1/2-inch cubes\n1 large Egg\n180ml Buttermilk, very cold (see Baker’s Notes for substitutions)\n1 large Egg, beaten with 15ml of milk or cream (for the egg wash)\n\n\n\n2.7.4 Equipment\n\nLarge mixing bowl\nPastry blender or two knives (or a food processor)\n2.5-inch round biscuit or cookie cutter\nBaking sheet lined with parchment paper\nPastry brush\n\n\n\n2.7.5 Instructions\n\nPrepare Your Station: Preheat your oven to 200°C (400F). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.\nCombine Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt.\nCut in the Butter: Add the cold, cubed butter to the flour mixture. Using a pastry blender or your fingertips, quickly cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces of butter still visible. (For modern convenience, you can pulse the dry ingredients and butter in a food processor 8-10 times until the correct texture is reached. Then, transfer to a bowl.)\nMix the Wet Ingredients: In a separate small bowl, whisk the egg and the cold buttermilk together until just combined.\nForm the Dough: Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients. Use a fork or a spatula to mix until a shaggy, slightly sticky dough begins to form. Do not overmix! It’s okay if there are a few dry patches.\nA Quick Knead: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently and quickly knead the dough just 3-4 times to bring it together into a cohesive ball. It should still look a little rough.\nPat and Cut: Gently pat the dough into a round that is about 3/4-inch to 1-inch thick. Using a 2.5-inch round cutter dipped in flour, press straight down to cut out your scones. Do not twist the cutter. Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet, about an inch apart. Gently bring the scraps together, pat down, and cut out more scones until all the dough is used.\nThe Finishing Touch: Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the tops (but not the sides) of the scones with the egg wash. This will give them a beautiful, glossy golden-brown finish.\nBake: Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the scones have risen high and are a lovely golden brown.\nCool: Transfer the scones to a wire rack to cool slightly. They are best served warm on the day they are made.\n\n\n\n2.7.6 Baker’s Notes, Variations & Serving\n\nButtermilk Substitute: If you don’t have buttermilk, you can make a quick version. Add 1 tablespoon (15ml) of lemon juice or white vinegar to a measuring cup, then add enough whole milk to reach the 3/4-cup (180ml) line. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes before using. Alternatively, you can use heavy cream for a richer, more decadent scone.\nClassic Fruit Scones: For a traditional variation, gently fold 85g of dried currants or raisins into the dough just before you turn it out onto your work surface.\nSavory Cheese Scones: For a savory treat, reduce the sugar to 1 tablespoon. Add 113g of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and a pinch of cayenne pepper to the dry ingredients before cutting in the butter.\nFreezing for Later: You can freeze unbaked scones for future convenience. Cut them out, place them on a tray, and freeze until solid. Transfer to a freezer bag. They can be baked directly from frozen; just add 2-4 minutes to the baking time.\nHow to Serve a Proper Scone: A “Cream Tea” is the traditional way to enjoy scones. This involves serving them with clotted cream and strawberry or raspberry jam. As clotted cream can be hard to find in the U.S., here are some excellent alternatives:\n\nMock Clotted Cream: Beat 1 cup (240ml) of cold heavy cream to stiff peaks. In a separate bowl, whisk 113g of mascarpone cheese with 8g of powdered sugar until smooth. Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone.\nLightly Sweetened Whipped Cream: A simple and delicious option.\nCrème Fraîche: Offers a wonderful tangy richness.",

It is a fresh, herbal puree used to marinate meats for curries, stews, and barbeque. While traditionally made with chadon beni (culantro), this version uses cilantro, which is readily available and provides a similar profile.\n\n3.7.1 Ingredients\n\n100g (2 bunches) fresh cilantro (leaves and tender stems)\n100g (1 bunch) scallions (green onions), chopped\n50g (1 head) garlic, peeled (approx. 10-12 cloves)\n50g (approx. 4cm piece) fresh ginger, peeled\n15g (1-2) fresh hot peppers (Scotch Bonnet, Habanero, or Jalapeño), seeds removed for less heat\n15g (1 tbsp) dried thyme (or 1 bunch fresh)\n60ml white vinegar or lime juice\n30ml water (only if needed to help blend)\n\n\n\n3.7.2 Instructions\n\nRoughly chop the cilantro, scallions, and ginger.\nPlace all ingredients into a blender or food processor.\nPulse until you have a coarse paste. It should not be a smooth smoothie, but rather a textured, wet rub.\nStore in a glass jar in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, or freeze in ice cube trays.\n\n\n\n3.7.3 Preparation Suggestion: Trinidadian BBQ Chicken\nAttribution: A “New World” grill classic.\nUnlike American BBQ, which relies heavily on smoke and dry rubs, “Trini BBQ” relies on a wet, herbal marinade (Green Seasoning) followed by a sticky, ketchup-based glaze applied at the very end.\n\n3.7.3.1 Marinade Ingredients\n\n1.5 - 2 kg chicken leg quarters (bone-in, skin-on)\n120ml Green Seasoning (recipe above)\n30ml soy sauce\n15ml Worcestershire sauce\n10g salt\n5g black pepper\n\n\n\n3.7.3.2 Trini BBQ Sauce Ingredients\n\n240ml ketchup\n50g brown sugar\n30ml molasses\n15ml soy sauce\n15ml lime juice\n5g garlic powder\n2g dash of Angostura bitters (optional, but authentic) or a pinch of allspice\n\n\n\n3.7.3.3 Instructions\n1. The Marination\n\nClean and trim the chicken.\nIn a large bowl or ziplock bag, massage the chicken thoroughly with the Green Seasoning, soy sauce, Worcestershire, salt, and pepper.\nCrucial Step: Let this marinate for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight. The herbs need time to penetrate the meat.\n\n2. The Sauce\n\nWhile the grill heats, whisk together all BBQ sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside.\n\n3. The Grill\n\nPreheat your grill for two-zone cooking.\n\nHot Zone (Direct Heat): Aim for 400-450°F (200-230°C).\nCool Zone (Indirect Heat): Aim for 300-350°F (150-175°C).\n\nPlace the chicken on the cooler side (indirect heat), skin side up. Cover and cook for 35-40 minutes at approx. 350°F (175°C). You want the chicken mostly cooked through without burning the herbs.\nMove the chicken to the hot side of the grill (direct heat).\nBrush generously with the BBQ Sauce.\nGrill for 2-3 minutes per side, flipping and basting once more, until the sauce is bubbly, sticky, and charred in spots.\nServe immediately with extra sauce on the side.",

The natural pectin in the apples provides a luxurious thickness without needing cornstarch, and the winter spices (cinnamon, cloves) in the butter add a complex “secret ingredient” note that pairs perfectly with smoke.\n\n3.8.1 Ingredients\n\n240ml (1 cup) Instant Pot Apple Butter (see recipe above)\n120ml (1/2 cup) ketchup\n60ml (1/4 cup) apple cider vinegar (or white vinegar)\n30ml (2 tbsp) Worcestershire sauce\n15g (1 tbsp) brown sugar (optional, depending on how sweet your apple butter is)\n8g (1 tbsp) smoked paprika\n4g (1 tsp) garlic powder\n4g (1 tsp) onion powder\n1-2g cayenne pepper (to taste)\n\n\n\n3.8.2 Instructions\n\nCombine: In a medium saucepan, whisk together all the ingredients.\nSimmer: Bring the mixture to a gentle bubble over medium-low heat. Let it simmer for 5-10 minutes. Note: You aren’t really “cooking” it since the apple butter is already done; you are just marrying the flavors and blooming the paprika.\nAdjust: Taste the sauce.\n\nIf it’s too thick, splash in a little water or more vinegar.\nIf it’s too tart, add the brown sugar.\n\nStore: Keep in a jar in the fridge for up to a month. The flavors will improve after sitting for 24 hours.\n\n\n\n3.8.3 Preparation Suggestion: Kansas City Style “Burnt Ends” Chicken\nAttribution: A technique for turning chicken thighs into bite-sized BBQ candy.\nWhile “burnt ends” are traditionally made from beef brisket, this technique mimics that texture using chicken thighs. By cutting the chicken before grilling, you maximize the surface area for the rub and the glaze, ensuring every bite is sticky, smoky, and charred.\n\n3.8.3.1 Ingredients\n\n1kg (2.2 lbs) boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n1 batch Apple Butter BBQ Sauce (approx. 300-400ml)\n\n\n\n3.8.3.2 The Rub\n\n10g (2 tsp) salt\n5g (2 tsp) smoked paprika\n5g (1 tsp) black pepper\n5g (1 tsp) garlic powder\n\n\n\n3.8.3.3 Instructions\n1. Prep the Chicken\n\nCut the chicken thighs into 4-5cm (1.5-2 inch) chunks. Trim off any excessive loose fat, but leave some for flavor.\n\n2. Season\n\nToss the chicken chunks in a bowl with the Rub ingredients until thoroughly coated.\n\n3. The Cook (Two Options)\n\nMethod A: Grill (Preferred)\n\nPreheat grill to medium-high (approx. 400°F / 200°C).\nGrill the chicken chunks for 3-4 minutes per side until they develop a nice char and are mostly cooked through. Tip: Use a grill basket or skewers if your grates are wide so you don’t lose any meat.\n\nMethod B: Oven Roast\n\nPreheat oven to 425°F (220°C).\nArrange chicken on a foil-lined baking sheet.\nBake for 15-18 minutes until browned.\n\n\n4. The “Burnt End” Finish\n\nTransfer the cooked chicken chunks into a large bowl.\nPour the Apple Butter BBQ Sauce over the chicken and toss to coat heavily.\nReturn to heat:\n\nGrill: Place the sauced chunks back on the grill (or in a disposable foil pan on the grill) for 2-3 minutes, tossing often, until the sauce is tacky and caramelized.\nOven: Return the baking sheet to the oven (or switch to broiler) for 3-5 minutes until the sauce bubbles and darkens.\n\nServe: Pile onto a platter and serve with toothpicks or over rice.",

    "text": "3.9 Jamaican Jerk Marinade (The Spicy/Aromatic Profile)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA complex, fiery marinade defined by the heat of scotch bonnets and the warmth of allspice. It’s an aromatic powerhouse that transforms simple chicken into a culinary event.\n\n\nAttribution: The “Pantry Raid” Classic.\nThis marinade is the perfect example of how the same ingredients can create vastly different cuisines. By taking the “sweet” spices from the Apple Butter chapter (allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg) and combining them with the savory engines of the Main Courses chapter (soy sauce, ginger, green onions), you create the unmistakable, fiery, and aromatic profile of authentic Jerk.\n\n3.9.1 Ingredients\n\n3.9.1.1 The Fresh Base\n\n100g (1 bunch) scallions (green onions), chopped (green and white parts). Sub: Use 1 additional medium onion (red or yellow).\n30-40g (6-8 cloves) garlic, peeled\n30g (approx. 2 tbsp) fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped\n15-45g (1-3) Scotch Bonnet or Habanero peppers (adjust for heat; remove seeds for a milder version). Sub: 30-40g (2-3) Jalapeños, or 5-10g (1-2 tsp) Cayenne powder.\n150g (1 medium) onion, roughly chopped\n\n\n\n3.9.1.2 The Liquids\n\n60ml (1/4 cup) soy sauce\n30ml (2 tbsp) vegetable oil\n30ml (2 tbsp) white vinegar or lime juice\n\n\n\n3.9.1.3 The Dry Spices\n\n30g (2 tbsp) brown sugar\n15g (1 tbsp) dried thyme (or 2 tbsp fresh leaves)\n8g (1 tbsp) ground allspice (essential)\n4g (1 tsp) ground cinnamon\n4g (1 tsp) ground nutmeg\n5g (1 tsp) salt\n5g (1 tsp) black pepper\n\n\n\n\n3.9.2 Instructions\n\nCombine: Place all ingredients into a blender or food processor.\nBlend: Pulse until you have a thick, somewhat chunky paste. It should be darker than the Green Seasoning due to the soy sauce and spices.\nStore: This is a powerful marinade. It keeps in the fridge for 2-3 weeks.\n\n\n\n3.9.3 Preparation Suggestion: “Sunday Best” Jerk Chicken\nAttribution: Adapting the “Pimento Wood” method for a gas or charcoal grill.\nTrue Jerk chicken is smoked over fresh pimento (allspice) wood, which gives it a distinct flavor. Since we can’t easily get that wood, we mimic the effect by using a heavy coating of the allspice-rich marinade and a slow, two-zone cooking method that allows the paste to form a dark, flavorful “bark” without burning.\n\n3.9.3.1 Ingredients\n\n1.5 - 2 kg chicken pieces (bone-in, skin-on thighs and legs are best)\n240ml (1 cup) Jamaican Jerk Marinade (recipe above)\n\n\n\n3.9.3.2 Instructions\n1. The Score\n\nUsing a sharp knife, make 2-3 deep slashes in the meat of each chicken piece, cutting all the way to the bone. Why? This allows the marinade to penetrate deep into the meat and helps it cook evenly.\n\n2. The Rub\n\nWear gloves (the peppers are hot!). Massage the marinade into the chicken, pushing it specifically into the slashes you just cut and under the skin.\n\n3. The Wait\n\nMarinate for at least 4 hours, but 24 hours is ideal. The longer it sits, the better it gets.\n\n4. The Cook\n\nPreheat: Set up your grill for two-zone cooking.\n\nHot Zone (Direct Heat): Aim for 400-450°F (200-230°C).\nCool Zone (Indirect Heat): Aim for 300-350°F (150-175°C).\n\nSlow Roast: Place the chicken on the cool side of the grill, skin-side up. Close the lid and let it roast indirectly for 40-50 minutes. You want the chicken to be fully cooked and the marinade to look dry and baked-on.\nThe Char: Move the chicken over to the hot side of the grill. Sear for 2-4 minutes per side, flipping often, until the skin is crisp and you have that signature blackened char.\nServe: Serve with rice and peas or hard dough bread to soak up the heat.",

A soy-forward marinade loaded with cumin and garlic that creates a deeply savory, dark-roasted skin.\n\n\nAttribution: The “Umami” Roast.\nThis marinade is the secret behind the addictive charcoal-roasted chicken of Peru. It relies on a heavy hand with Cumin and Soy Sauce, creating a dark, savory skin that tastes like it spent hours over a wood fire, even when cooked in a standard oven.\n\n3.10.1 Ingredients\n\n60ml (1/4 cup) soy sauce\n60ml (1/4 cup) white vinegar (or red wine vinegar if you have it)\n30ml (2 tbsp) vegetable oil\n30-40g (6-8 cloves) garlic, minced (or 1 tbsp garlic paste)\n15g (1 tbsp) ground cumin (don’t be shy!)\n15g (1 tbsp) paprika (smoked paprika works great here too)\n5g (1 tsp) dried oregano\n5g (1 tsp) black pepper\n2g (1/2 tsp) salt (go easy, as the soy sauce is salty)\n\n\n\n3.10.2 Instructions\n\nWhisk: Combine all ingredients in a bowl or jar. Whisk until the spices are well hydrated.\nTexture: The marinade will be thin and dark. This is correct; it’s meant to penetrate the meat rather than sit on top like a glaze.\nStore: Keeps for 1 week in the fridge.\n\n\n\n3.10.3 Preparation Suggestion: Peruvian “Rotisserie-Style” Roast Chicken\nAttribution: Achieving the “charcoal” crisp in a home oven.\nThe signature of Pollo a la Brasa is the crispy, salty skin. To replicate this without a rotisserie, we roast at a higher temperature than normal.\n\n3.10.3.1 Ingredients\n\n1 Whole Chicken (approx. 1.5 - 1.8 kg), or 1.5 kg of bone-in chicken quarters\n1 batch Pollo a la Brasa Marinade (recipe above)\n\n\n\n3.10.3.2 Instructions\n1. Marinate\n\nPlace the chicken in a large ziplock bag. Pour the marinade in.\nCrucial Step: Massage the marinade under the skin of the breast and thighs. This ensures the meat turns dark and flavorful.\nLet it sit for at least 6 hours, ideally 24 hours.\n\n2. Prep\n\nPreheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).\n\n3. Roast\n\nPlace the chicken on a wire rack set over a baking sheet (or in a roasting pan). The rack is important for air circulation.\nRoast for 45-60 minutes.\nTip: If the skin starts getting too dark (due to the soy sauce caramelizing), tent a piece of foil over the breast for the last 15 minutes.\n\n4. Rest\n\nLet the chicken rest for 10 minutes before carving.\n\n\n\n3.10.3.3 Serving Suggestion: “Green Sauce” (Aji Verde)\nServe this with a quick blender sauce using your existing pantry staples:\n\n110g (1/2 cup) Mayonnaise\n50g (1 bunch) fresh Cilantro (stems and all)\n15-30g (1-2) Jalapeños (or heavy pinch of cayenne)\n5g (1 clove) Garlic\n5g (1 tbsp) Parmesan Cheese (from the Pizza recipe)\n30ml (1 lime) Juice of 1 lime (or splash of vinegar)\n\nInstructions: Blend until smooth and green. Dip the chicken (and fries!) in it.",

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\n\nActual Karachi-style chicken karahi wouldn’t use an onion. I do. We like the addition of the umami notes. You do you.\nThis is a lot of oil. Evidently the oil separation (or “tarka”) is a desired visual cue in a good karahi. Frying the tomato paste and masala before the chicken has helped absorb the oil, but a tarka is still present after the dish stands for a little.\nThis recipe is scaled to a can of tomato paste. This is because:\n\nTomato paste is already cooked, so you don’t need as much time to develop the tomato flavor.\nChicken available in America has a lot more water than desi chicken. Using tomato paste instead of tomatoes or tomato sauce helps us keep the dish from getting watery.\nThis isn’t a lot of tomato paste, but cooking it first gets the maximum amount of flavor from the one can. If you don’t cook it first, you’ll probably want a second or third can.\nThe amount of oil and water is also approximately one 6oz can, so you can reuse the tomato paste can for a measure.\n\nFor a charsi or Peshawari-style karahi omit the onion, tomato, and spices other than salt and pepper.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.1 Ingredients\n\nChicken: about 1.5 kg (3.3 lbs) boneless chicken thighs\nGhee or Oil: 120ml\nOnion: 1 medium onion, finely diced\nTomato Paste: 1 can (170g)\nGarlic: 75ml, minced or crushed\nGinger: 75ml, minced or crushed (plus a small amount, julienned, for garnish)\nWater or Chicken Broth: 120ml\nGreen Chilies: 6-8, slit lengthwise\n\n\n4.1.1.1 Spices:\n\nSalt: 12-18g\nCoriander Powder: 6g\nCumin Powder: 7g total\nRed Chili Powder or Paprika: 6-10g\nBlack Peppercorns: 7g, freshly crushed\nAllspice: 1g Note: Use at the end!\n\n\n\n4.1.1.2 Garnishes:\n\nFresh Cilantro: A generous handful, chopped\nFresh Ginger: A small amount, julienned\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Instructions\n\nSauté the Onion: Heat the ghee or oil in a large wok or pot over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes until it is soft and translucent.\nBloom the Tomato Paste: Add the tomato paste to the wok and stir it in with the onion. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the color deepens.\nAdd Aromatics: Add the minced ginger and garlic. Add the coriander powder, 6g of cumin powder, red chili, and black pepper. Cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.\nFry the Chicken: Add the chicken pieces to the wok. Increase the heat to high. Stir well and cook for 5-7 minutes until the chicken is browned and the spices are fragrant.\nSimmer: Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add 120ml of water or broth. Stir, then cover and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is tender. The sauce should be thick.\nFinal Touches: Remove the lid and increase the heat to high. Cook and stir for a few minutes until the sauce thickens and the oil begins to separate from the masala. If there is an excessive amount of oil, you can carefully tip the wok and spoon some of it out.\nAdd Finishing Spices: Turn off the heat. Stir in the green chilies, julienned fresh ginger, chopped cilantro, the remaining 1g of cumin, and the 1g of allspice.",

This is crucial for proper cooking and achieving the right texture.\n\nCook the Lentils and Kidney Beans:\n\nDrain the soaked lentils and kidney beans.\nTransfer them to a pot or pressure cooker with fresh water (enough to cover them by about 5cm). Add salt to taste.\nCook until they are very soft and mushy. This will take longer than other lentils.\n\nStovetop: Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 1-2 hours, or until the lentils and beans are completely tender and can be easily mashed. You may need to add more water during cooking.\nPressure Cooker: Cook for 8-10 whistles on medium heat. Allow the pressure to release naturally.\nInstant Pot: Cook on high pressure for 30-40 minutes, followed by a natural pressure release for at least 15 minutes, then a manual release if needed.\n\n\nPrepare the Base Flavor:\n\nHeat butter or ghee in a separate heavy-bottomed pan or or pot over medium heat.\nAdd the finely chopped onions and sauté until they are golden brown (about 8-10 minutes).\nAdd the tomato paste and 120ml of water. Cook, stirring constantly, for 3-5 minutes until the paste has deepened in color and the oil starts to separate.\nAdd the ginger paste and sauté for another minute until fragrant.\nStir in the cumin powder, allspice powder, and red chili powder. Sauté for about 30 seconds, stirring continuously.\n\nCombine Lentils and Base:\n\nPour the cooked lentils and kidney beans (along with the cooking liquid) into the pan with the tomato-onion base.\nMix well and bring to a gentle simmer.\n\nSimmer and Cream:\n\nReduce the heat to low, cover the pan partially, and let the dal simmer for at least 30-45 minutes, or even longer if time permits. This slow simmering helps the flavors meld together and creates a creamy texture. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.\nStir in the fresh cream. Simmer for another 5-10 minutes. Adjust the consistency by adding more cream or a little water if needed. Check and adjust the salt.\n\nGarnish and Serve:\n\nGarnish with thinly sliced fresh ginger juliennes and a squeeze of lemon juice at the end.\nServe hot with naan, roti, paratha, or rice. A dollop of extra butter or cream on top is often added before serving for extra richness.\n\nKey to Dal Makhani’s Richness:\n\nWhole Black Lentils and Kidney Beans: These specific lentils and beans contribute to the unique texture and flavor.\nSlow Cooking: Long, slow simmering is essential for developing the rich and creamy consistency.\nButter and Cream: Generous use of butter (or ghee) and fresh cream is what gives Dal Makhani its signature luxuriousness.",

As people took a serving out of the pot, they would add whatever they had (meat, vegetables, etc.) to the stew. Because I have gout, I’ve made some notes to help lower purine.",

    "text": "5.1.1 Foundational Principles\nKeep these in mind for gout-friendliness:\n\nProtein: For low-purine options. Chicken (breast is best), turkey, or lean fish. Avoid organ meats, red meats, and shellfish.\nThickener: Use starches like flour, cornstarch, rice, or potatoes to thicken the stew.\nFlavor: Rely on a base of vegetables, herbs, and spices rather than high-purine meat broths.\n\n\n\n5.1.2 1. Building the Flavor Base (The Sauté)\nThis is the most important step for a rich, deep flavor. This is where you start your stew.\n\nFats: 15-30ml of olive oil.\nAromatics: Always start with these. Finely chop onions, shallots, or garlic. Sauté them until they are soft and translucent.\n“Long-Cooking” Vegetables: These need a head start to become tender. Add these after the aromatics and sauté them for a few minutes.\n\nCarrots\nCelery\nParsnips\nTurnips\nHard squash (like butternut or pumpkin)\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 2. Adding the Protein and Spices\nOnce your flavor base is sautéed, it’s time to bring in the main ingredients.\n\nProtein: Add your cubed chicken or turkey. Sauté it until it’s lightly browned on all sides. This adds a great layer of flavor.\nDry Spices: Add your spices now, such as paprika, cumin, oregano, black pepper, and a very small amount of cloves or cardamom. Sautéing the spices for about a minute will “bloom” them and release their full aroma.\nThickener (if using flour): Sprinkle about 30ml of flour over the ingredients. Stir constantly for 1-2 minutes until it coats everything and forms a paste.\n\n\n\n5.1.4 3. The Simmering Stage\nNow you add the liquid and the ingredients that need a long time to cook through.\n\nLiquid: Slowly pour in your unsalted broth or water, stirring to prevent any lumps from forming if you used flour. Add enough liquid to just barely cover the ingredients.\n“Hard” Ingredients: Add any ingredients that require a long cooking time to become tender and help thicken the stew.\n\nPotatoes (cut into large chunks)\nRice (120ml is a good start)\nBay leaves\n\nSimmer: Bring the stew to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cover the pot and let it cook for at least 30-45 minutes.\n\n\n\n5.1.5 4. Finishing the Stew\nTowards the end of the cooking process, add the ingredients that cook more quickly.\n\n“Quick-Cooking” Vegetables: These will become mushy if added too early. Add these 15-20 minutes before the stew is done.\n\nBell peppers\nCabbage\nZucchini or summer squash\nMushrooms\n\nRemaining Thickener: If you didn’t use flour and the stew isn’t as thick as you want, mix cornstarch with a little cold water to make a slurry. Stir it in and simmer until thickened.\nSeasoning and Fresh Herbs: Once the stew is ready, remove the bay leaves. Taste and add salt as needed. Stir in fresh herbs like chopped parsley or basil to add a bright flavor.",

    "text": "5.3 Easy Butter Chicken Soup\nAttribution: Simply Delicious Food\n\n5.3.1 Ingredients\n\n5.3.1.1 For the Chicken\n\n500g (1.1 lbs) boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n15ml (1 tbsp) canola oil / vegetable oil\n11.25g (2.25 tsp) cumin\n3.75g (0.75 tsp) allspice\n2.5g (½ tsp) ground cardamom\n2.5g (½ tsp) paprika\n5g (1 tsp) salt\n\n\n\n5.3.1.2 For the Soup\n\n100g (1/2 cup) dried Great Northern or cannellini beans\n28g (2 tbsp) butter\n1 onion, finely chopped\n10g (2 tsp) crushed garlic\n5g (1 tsp) crushed ginger\n7.5g (1.5 tsp) cumin\n2.5g (0.5 tsp) allspice\n5g (1 tsp) paprika\n5g (1 tsp) ground cardamom\n5g (1 tsp) turmeric (optional, for color)\n170g (6 oz) tomato paste\n960ml (4 cups) chicken stock\n5-10g (1-2 tsp) salt\n5g (1 tsp) pepper\n5g (1 tsp) sugar\n360ml (1.5 cups) heavy / whipping cream\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Instructions\n\n5.3.2.1 Prepare the Beans\n\nSoak the beans: The night before, rinse the dried beans and place them in a large bowl with enough water to cover them by at least 2 inches. Let them soak overnight.\nCook the beans: Drain the soaked beans.\n\nStovetop: Place the beans in a pot with fresh water to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 1-1.5 hours, or until tender.\nPressure Cooker / Instant Pot: Place the beans in the pressure cooker with fresh water to cover. Cook on high pressure for 10-15 minutes, followed by a natural pressure release. Once cooked, drain the beans and set them aside.\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2.2 Make the Soup\n\nSlice and season the chicken: Slice the chicken into small, bite-size pieces. In a medium bowl, toss the chicken with the oil, cumin, allspice, cardamom, paprika, and salt.\nSear the chicken: In a large, deep pot, sear the chicken until browned on both sides. Remove from the pot and set aside.\nSauté aromatics: In the same pot, melt the butter then add the onion, garlic, and ginger. Cook until fragrant.\nToast spices and bloom tomato paste: Add the remaining spices (and turmeric, if using) and the tomato paste to the pot. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the spices are fragrant and the tomato paste has deepened in color.\nSimmer the sauce with beans: Pour in the chicken stock, add the cooked beans, and stir to combine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it cook for 10 minutes.\nPurée the sauce: Use an immersion blender to blend the sauce and beans until completely smooth and creamy.\nAdd chicken: Return the seared chicken to the puréed sauce and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.\nFinish the soup: Stir in the heavy cream and season with salt, pepper, and sugar.\nServe: Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with a drizzle of cream, fresh cilantro, and fresh chilies (optional).\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Chef’s Notes\n\nBouillon Substitute: If you don’t have chicken stock on hand, you can use bouillon cubes or powder. A good rule of thumb is 1 teaspoon of bouillon powder or 1 cube per cup (240ml) of water. For this recipe, you would use 4 teaspoons of powder or 4 cubes dissolved in 960ml (4 cups) of water.\nMilk Substitute for Cream: If you don’t have heavy cream, you can use whole milk with a few adjustments. To achieve a similar richness and prevent curdling, reduce the chicken stock by 1 cup (240ml). Before adding the milk, temper it by slowly whisking about a cup of the hot soup into the milk. Then, stir the warmed milk mixture back into the pot. For extra richness, you can also add another tablespoon of butter at this stage.\nCanned Bean Shortcut: To save time, you can use one 15 oz (425g) can of Great Northern or cannellini beans. Simply rinse and drain them, skip the “Prepare the Beans” section, and add them to the soup along with the chicken stock.\nCanned Chicken Variation: For an even quicker soup, you can substitute one 12.5 oz (355g) can of cooked chicken breast. If you do, you can skip the “Slice and season the chicken” and “Sear the chicken” steps. Drain the chicken and add it to the soup for the final 10-15 minutes of simmering. Note that this will change the final flavor, as you will miss the depth developed from searing fresh chicken.",

    "text": "7.3 Chocolate Chip Cookies\nAttribution: Claire Saffitz\n\n7.3.1 Ingredients\n\n7.3.1.1 Wet Ingredients\n\n227g (16 tbsp) unsalted butter, cut into tablespoons\n28g (2 tbsp) heavy cream, half-and-half, or whole milk\n100g (2 large) eggs, cold from the refrigerator\n1 tbsp vanilla extract\n\n\n\n7.3.1.2 Dry Ingredients\n\n260g (2 cups) all-purpose flour\n150g (3/4 cup packed) dark brown sugar\n150g (3/4 cup) granulated sugar\n6g (2 tsp) Diamond Crystal kosher salt\n6g (1 tsp) baking soda\n\n\n\n7.3.1.3 Chocolate\n\n142g (5 ounces) bittersweet chocolate disks, half coarsely chopped\n142g (5 ounces) milk chocolate disks, half coarsely chopped\n\n\n\n\n7.3.2 Instructions\n\nBrown the Butter: Melt the butter in a saucepan over moderate heat. Continuously scrape the bottom and stir to prevent milk solids from sticking and burning. Moderate the heat to keep it on the lower side to avoid burning. Continue cooking until the butter passes golden brown and reaches a very dark, but not burned, color. You’ll see fine foam and brown bits at the bottom.\nCool the Butter Mixture: Immediately remove the browned butter from the heat. Add 2 tablespoons of cold heavy cream (or half-and-half/whole milk) to the hot butter. Transfer the mixture to a bowl and let it cool. Stir the mixture frequently while it cools to ensure it remains homogeneous and doesn’t separate. It should become opaque and smooth.\nMix the Batter: Once the butter mixture has cooled, whisk in the dark brown sugar and granulated sugar until smooth and homogeneous. Do not cream until light and fluffy, as you don’t want a lot of air in the batter. Add the cold large eggs, one at a time, whisking well after each addition until fully incorporated and the mixture takes on a silkier appearance. Whisk in the vanilla extract.\nCombine Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and kosher salt.\nPrepare the Chocolate: Coarsely chop half of both the bittersweet and milk chocolate disks. Keep the other half whole. This creates different sizes of chocolate in the cookie.\nFinish the Dough: Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and whisk until just combined. If the butter was solid, you might need to switch to a spatula. Fold in both the chopped and whole chocolate pieces, ensuring to include any chocolate dust from chopping.\nPortion and Chill the Dough: Using a 2-ounce scoop or ¼ cup measure, portion the dough onto baking sheets. You can place them close together as they will be chilled. Optionally, press an extra chocolate disk on top of each portion for a more photogenic look. Cover the baking sheet and chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours, and up to 48 hours. For longer storage (up to 3 days), transfer to the freezer. Chilling allows the butter to solidify, sugar to recrystallize, and flavors to develop, resulting in a chewier, more flavorful cookie.\nBake the Cookies: Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F). Arrange six portions of dough on a baking sheet, spacing them out as they will spread. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Look for a golden brown edge and a pale, slightly shiny interior.\nCool and Serve: Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for about 5 minutes, as they are delicate when hot. Transfer them to a wire rack to finish cooling. Enjoy the cookies, which will have a crispy edge and a gooey, warm center.",

    "text": "7.4 Julia Child’s Fluffy Pumpkin Pie\nAttribution: Based on Julia Child’s Fluffy Pumpkin Pie Review from Simply Recipes.\n\n7.4.1 Yield\nTwo 9-inch pies (Serves 16)\n\n\n7.4.2 Ingredients\n\n2 prepared pie crusts (unbaked), chilled\n820g (29 oz) pumpkin purée (2 x 15oz cans or 1 x 29oz can)\n200g (1 cup) granulated sugar\n220g (1 cup packed) light brown sugar\n240ml (1 cup) heavy cream\n180ml (3/4 cup) whole milk\n5 large egg yolks\n45ml (3 tbsp) molasses\n45ml (3 tbsp) spiced rum or bourbon\n8g (3 tsp) ground cinnamon\n5g (3 tsp) ground ginger\n6g (1 tsp) salt\n0.5g (1/4 tsp) ground nutmeg\n0.5g (1/4 tsp) ground cloves\n5 large egg whites\n\n\n\n7.4.3 Instructions\n\nPreheat: Place a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 230°C (450°F). Lightly grease two 9-inch pie pans.\nPrepare Crust: Line the two pie pans with the pie dough, trimming and crimping the edges. The edge should extend about 1/2 inch above the pan. Refrigerate while making the filling.\nMake Filling Base: In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin purée, granulated sugar, brown sugar, heavy cream, milk, egg yolks, molasses, rum (or bourbon), cinnamon, ginger, salt, nutmeg, and cloves until well mixed.\nWhip Egg Whites: In a stand mixer with the whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), beat the egg whites on medium-low speed until foamy. Increase speed and beat until stiff peaks form. Do not over-beat.\nFold: Add a quarter of the egg whites to the pumpkin mixture and mix to lighten it. Carefully fold in the remaining egg whites until just combined.\nBake: Immediately divide the filling between the two prepared pie pans and smooth the tops. Place in the oven and bake for 15 minutes at 230°C (450°F).\nReduce Heat: Without opening the oven, reduce the temperature to 190°C (375°F) and bake for another 15 minutes.\nReduce Heat Again: Reduce the temperature to 175°C (350°F) and bake for a final 15 minutes. Check for doneness: a thin skewer inserted two inches from the edge should come out clean. If not, bake in 5-minute increments.\nCool: Turn off the oven, prop the door open slightly with a wooden spoon, and let the pies cool slowly in the oven for 30 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack to finish cooling. Serve slightly warm or chilled.\n\nChef’s Notes:\n\nThis recipe relies on the initial high oven temperature (450°F) to set the bottom crust, so parbaking is not required. Ensure your pie dough is well-chilled before baking to prevent shrinking.\nThe original recipe calls for 4 egg yolks and 5 egg whites; I have adjusted this to 5 yolks to avoid a leftover yolk and add richness.",

    "text": "8.1.1 Ingredients\n\n240ml freshly squeezed lemon juice (about 4-6 large lemons)\n200g granulated sugar\n960-1200ml cold water (adjust to taste)\nIce\n\n\n8.1.1.1 For Garnish\n\nOptional: lemon slices for garnish\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Instructions\n\nMake a Simple Syrup: In a small saucepan, combine 200g of sugar and 240ml of water. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved. Do not boil. Remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature. This step is crucial for “state fair” quality lemonade, as it prevents a gritty texture from undissolved sugar.\nJuice the Lemons: While the simple syrup cools, squeeze your lemons to get about 240ml of fresh lemon juice. Roll the lemons on the counter before cutting them in half to help extract more juice. Strain out any seeds or excessive pulp if you prefer.\nCombine Ingredients: In a large pitcher, combine the cooled simple syrup and the fresh lemon juice.\nAdd Water and Adjust: Gradually add 720-960ml of cold water, stirring well after each addition. Taste the lemonade as you go and adjust the amount of water to achieve your desired level of sweetness and tartness. Some prefer a stronger, more tart lemonade, while others like it sweeter.\nChill and Serve: For best results, chill the lemonade in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. This allows the flavors to meld and ensures it’s refreshingly cold. Serve over ice, with lemon slices for garnish if desired.\n\nNote: You can add some lemon zest to the syrup for extra flavor. You can also use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh if time is a factor.",
