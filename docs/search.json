    "text": "1.2 Quarter Sheet Pan Egg Roulade\nYields: 4-6 servings Prep time: 15 minutes Cook time: 20-30 minutes (total)\n\n1.2.1 Ingredients:\nFor the Egg Base:\n\n4 large eggs\n30ml milk or cream\nSalt and pepper to taste\nOptional flavorings: herbs (chives, parsley, dill), grated cheese, spices (nutmeg, paprika)\n\nFor the Filling (choose one or a combination of these pork-free options):\n\nCooked and crumbled turkey sausage or beef sausage\nShredded or diced chicken\nShredded cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, Gruyere, goat cheese)\nSautéed vegetables (spinach, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers)\nSmoked salmon or other cured fish\nFresh herbs (basil, cilantro)\nCream cheese or other spreadable cheese\nRoasted red peppers, chopped\nSun-dried tomatoes, chopped\n\nFor Rolling:\n\nParchment paper\nCooking spray or butter for greasing\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Equipment:\n\nA 23x33cm rimmed baking pan\nLarge mixing bowl\nWhisk\nRubber spatula\nSharp knife\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Instructions:\nPrepare the Baking Pan:\n\nPreheat your oven to 175°C.\nLightly grease your 23x33cm baking pan with cooking spray or butter.\nLine the pan with a piece of parchment paper that overhangs the two long edges. The overhang is crucial for lifting and rolling the roulade. You can also lightly grease the parchment paper for extra insurance against sticking.\n\nMake the Egg Base:\n\nIn a large mixing bowl, whisk the 4 large eggs until they are light and slightly frothy.\nWhisk in the milk or cream until well combined.\nSeason generously with salt and pepper.\nIf desired, whisk in any optional flavorings like chopped herbs, grated cheese, or spices.\n\nBake the Egg Base:\n\nPour the egg mixture evenly onto the prepared 23x33cm pan.\nBake for 10-15 minutes, or until the eggs are just set and no longer liquid in the center. The surface should be slightly spongy to the touch. Be very careful not to overbake, as this is the most common reason for cracking.\n\nCool Slightly and Add Filling:\n\nRemove the pan from the oven and let the egg sheet cool for about 5 minutes. This makes it easier to handle.\nCarefully loosen the edges of the egg sheet from the parchment paper using a thin spatula or knife.\nEvenly distribute your chosen filling ingredients over the surface, leaving a small border (about 1.25cm) along one of the long edges to help with rolling.\n\nRoll the Roulade:\n\nStarting from one of the long edges, begin to gently roll the egg sheet up like a jelly roll. Use the parchment paper overhang to help you lift and guide the roll. Roll it tightly and evenly.\nOnce fully rolled, position the roulade seam-side down on the baking sheet (still lined with parchment).\n\nHeat Through (Optional):\n\nIf you want to melt cheese or heat the filling, you can return the rolled roulade to the oven for another 5-10 minutes.\n\nCool and Serve:\n\nLet the roulade cool for a few minutes before slicing with a sharp knife. This will help it hold its shape and prevent the filling from oozing out.",

Sprinkle the remaining cheese and any other toppings (like fresh herbs) over the top.\n\nBake:\n\nCarefully place the pan in the preheated oven. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the eggs are set and the top is lightly golden.

    "text": "2.2 Peri-Peri Chicken Thighs (Scaled for 3.5 kg)\nThis recipe makes a vibrant and flavorful peri-peri chicken, perfect for grilling. It’s designed for boneless, skinless chicken thighs, and features a unique blend of spices including dried jalapeño flakes, Kashmiri red pepper, and ginger.\n\nYields: 3.5 kg of chicken (approx. 7-10 chicken thighs)\nPrep time: 20 minutes (plus 4-24 hours marination)\nCook time: 15-20 minutes per batch\n\n\n2.2.1 Ingredients\nFor the Marinade:\n\n30-40 ml (approx. 20-25 g) dried jalapeño flakes (see note 1)\n2-3 large red bell peppers\n25-35 g minced garlic (see note 2)\n150 ml rice wine vinegar (see note 3)\n30-60 ml lemon juice (see note 7)\n150 ml olive oil (or neutral oil)\n10-12 g Kashmiri red pepper powder (see note 4)\n3-4 g cayenne powder (see note 5 - adjust to taste)\n8-10 g onion powder\n8-10 g dried oregano\n8-10 g salt (adjust to taste)\n3-4 g black pepper\n5-7 g sugar\n8-10 g ginger paste (see note 6)\nMedium handful of fresh cilantro or parsley (optional)\n\nFor the Chicken:\n\n3.5 kg boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Instructions\n\nPrepare the Marinade:\n\nPrepare Dried Jalapeño Flakes: If your dried jalapeño flakes are very coarse, you can give them a quick pulse in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. They do not typically require rehydration as they will soften in the marinade.\nCombine the dried jalapeño flakes, red bell peppers, minced garlic, rice wine vinegar, lemon juice, olive oil, Kashmiri red pepper powder, cayenne powder, onion powder, dried oregano, salt, black pepper, sugar, ginger paste, and optional fresh herbs in a blender or food processor (you may need to blend in batches depending on blender size).\nBlend until the mixture is completely smooth. You can use a small amount of water or the jalapeño soaking liquid (if you rehydrated whole dried jalapeños) if needed to achieve a smooth consistency.\nTaste the marinade and adjust seasonings (salt, sugar, and especially heat from cayenne) to your preference.\nReserve about 1/4 of the marinade for basting during grilling and for serving with the cooked chicken. Do not use the reserved marinade on raw chicken to avoid cross-contamination.\n\nMarinate the Chicken:\n\nTrim any excess fat from the chicken thighs.\nPlace the chicken thighs in several large resealable plastic bags or large shallow dishes (you will likely need multiple).\nPour the main portion of the marinade over the chicken, ensuring each piece is thoroughly coated.\nSeal the bags or cover the dishes and refrigerate for a minimum of 4 hours, and ideally 8-24 hours for the best flavor penetration.\n\nBarbecue the Chicken:\n\nTake the chicken out of the refrigerator about 30 minutes before grilling to allow it to come to room temperature.\nPreheat your grill to a two-zone setup: one side on medium-high heat (direct heat) for searing, and the other side on low to medium heat (indirect heat) for cooking through. Lightly oil the grill grates.\nPlace the chicken thighs on the direct heat side of the grill in batches to avoid crowding. Sear for 2-3 minutes per side to get a nice char.\nMove the chicken to the indirect heat side of the grill. Close the lid and continue to cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 74°C (165°F).\nDuring the last few minutes of cooking, you can baste the chicken with the reserved marinade for extra flavor.\nOnce cooked, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before serving.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Notes on Substitutions and Ingredients:\n\nDried Jalapeño Flakes: We are assuming you have dried, crushed jalapeño flakes. If using whole dried jalapeños (which would be approximately 7-9 whole dried peppers for 3.5 kg of chicken), they should be rehydrated by soaking in boiling water for 20-30 minutes before blending. Fresh jalapeños can also be used, but the dried ones provide a more concentrated, smoky flavor.\nMinced Garlic: This is a direct substitution for garlic cloves. Approximately 1 teaspoon of minced garlic (5g) per medium clove.\nRice Wine Vinegar: This was used as a substitute for sherry or red wine vinegar. It offers a milder, slightly sweeter acidity.\nKashmiri Red Pepper Powder: Used for its vibrant color and mild, aromatic heat. If not available, regular paprika can be used, but the color may be less intense.\nCayenne Powder: Used for adjustable heat. This is a potent spice, so start with a small amount and add more to taste. You can also use red pepper flakes if preferred, but cayenne provides a more uniform heat throughout the marinade.\nGinger Paste: This was an addition for an extra layer of warmth, zest, and aromatic complexity. It pairs wonderfully with the other flavors.\nLemon Juice: This measurement assumes the use of readymade lemon juice. If using fresh lemons, the yield can vary, but typically 1-2 lemons will provide approximately 30-60 ml of juice.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "3.1.1 Foundational Principles\nKeep these in mind for gout-friendliness:\n\nProtein: For low-purine options. Chicken (breast is best), turkey, or lean fish. Avoid organ meats, red meats, and shellfish.\nThickener: Use starches like flour, cornstarch, rice, or potatoes to thicken the stew.\nFlavor: Rely on a base of vegetables, herbs, and spices rather than high-purine meat broths.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 1. Building the Flavor Base (The Sauté)\nThis is the most important step for a rich, deep flavor. This is where you start your stew.\n\nFats: 15-30ml of olive oil.\nAromatics: Always start with these. Finely chop onions, shallots, or garlic. Sauté them until they are soft and translucent.\n“Long-Cooking” Vegetables: These need a head start to become tender. Add these after the aromatics and sauté them for a few minutes.\n\nCarrots\nCelery\nParsnips\nTurnips\nHard squash (like butternut or pumpkin)\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 2. Adding the Protein and Spices\nOnce your flavor base is sautéed, it’s time to bring in the main ingredients.\n\nProtein: Add your cubed chicken or turkey. Sauté it until it’s lightly browned on all sides. This adds a great layer of flavor.\nDry Spices: Add your spices now, such as paprika, cumin, oregano, black pepper, and a very small amount of cloves or cardamom. Sautéing the spices for about a minute will “bloom” them and release their full aroma.\nThickener (if using flour): Sprinkle about 30ml of flour over the ingredients. Stir constantly for 1-2 minutes until it coats everything and forms a paste.\n\n\n\n3.1.4 3. The Simmering Stage\nNow you add the liquid and the ingredients that need a long time to cook through.\n\nLiquid: Slowly pour in your unsalted broth or water, stirring to prevent any lumps from forming if you used flour. Add enough liquid to just barely cover the ingredients.\n“Hard” Ingredients: Add any ingredients that require a long cooking time to become tender and help thicken the stew.\n\nPotatoes (cut into large chunks)\nRice (120ml is a good start)\nBay leaves\n\nSimmer: Bring the stew to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cover the pot and let it cook for at least 30-45 minutes.\n\n\n\n3.1.5 4. Finishing the Stew\nTowards the end of the cooking process, add the ingredients that cook more quickly.\n\n“Quick-Cooking” Vegetables: These will become mushy if added too early. Add these 15-20 minutes before the stew is done.\n\nBell peppers\nCabbage\nZucchini or summer squash\nMushrooms\n\nRemaining Thickener: If you didn’t use flour and the stew isn’t as thick as you want, mix cornstarch with a little cold water to make a slurry. Stir it in and simmer until thickened.\nSeasoning and Fresh Herbs: Once the stew is ready, remove the bay leaves. Taste and add salt as needed. Stir in fresh herbs like chopped parsley or basil to add a bright flavor.",

If you don’t have oyster sauce, you can simply use a little extra soy sauce and a pinch of sugar.\n\n30ml Ketchup\n30ml Worcestershire sauce (make sure it’s alcohol-free)\n15ml Soy sauce\n15ml Honey or Sugar\n\nCombine all ingredients in a small bowl and mix until smooth.\n\n\n3.3.3 Instructions\n\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the Okonomiyaki Flour and Water until the mixture is smooth.\nAdd the Egg, Cabbage, Onion, Tenkasu, Ginger, and any optional ingredients to the bowl and mix lightly. Be careful not to over-mix the batter.\nHeat a griddle or frying pan to 200°C (400°F) and oil it.\nPour the entire okonomiyaki mixture onto the griddle, forming one pancake.\nUse a spatula to flatten and shape the pancake to a thickness of about 1.5cm (3/4”).\nPlace the Turkey Bacon pieces on top, covering the surface.\nAfter about 3 minutes, flip the pancake over so the bacon side is down and cook for 4 minutes.\nFlip the pancake again (bacon side up) and cook for another 3 minutes, or until it is firm and well browned.\nRemove the finished pancake to a plate and drizzle with Kewpie mayonnaise and your homemade Okonomi sauce.

Strain and reserve the juices.\nLine a half sheet pan with parchment paper and place the ground meat in the middle of the pan. Cover the meat with a large sheet of plastic wrap and roll out the meat with a small rolling pin into a large rectangle that covers the surface of the pan; it will be very thin.\nAdd a thin layer of yellow mustard and season the meat with the spice mixture. Pick up the edge of the parchment and fold the meat in half, widthwise. Roll a couple of times just to seal the two layers.\nRefrigerate for 10 minutes then cut into 8 even squares with a pizza cutter.\nPreheat a griddle pan over medium heat. Spread the onions out on the griddle in an even layer in a rectangular shape. Put the patties on top of the onions. Resist the urge to press them with your spatula. Squeezing burger patties is the culinary equivalent of picking at a scab, and you remember what your mom told you about that.\nPour over some of the remaining onion juice to create steam. Top each patty with a slice of cheese and the bottom half of a bun. Cover the griddle with foil (but do not seal) and reduce the heat to low. Steam the burgers until cooked, 3 to 5 minutes.\nConstruct burgers thusly: Add pickles and mustard to each bun top. Using a large spatula, pick up a burger-bottom bun stack and place it on the top half of a bun. Repeat with the remaining burger stacks and bun tops until there’s nothing left to build. Consume mass quantities.",

This is crucial for proper cooking and achieving the right texture.\n\nCook the Lentils and Kidney Beans:\n\nDrain the soaked lentils and kidney beans.\nTransfer them to a pot or pressure cooker with fresh water (enough to cover them by about 5cm). Add salt to taste.\nCook until they are very soft and mushy. This will take longer than other lentils.\n\nStovetop: Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 1-2 hours, or until the lentils and beans are completely tender and can be easily mashed. You may need to add more water during cooking.\nPressure Cooker: Cook for 8-10 whistles on medium heat. Allow the pressure to release naturally.\nInstant Pot: Cook on high pressure for 30-40 minutes, followed by a natural pressure release for at least 15 minutes, then a manual release if needed.\n\n\nPrepare the Base Flavor:\n\nHeat butter or ghee in a separate heavy-bottomed pan or or pot over medium heat.\nAdd the finely chopped onions and sauté until they are golden brown (about 8-10 minutes).\nAdd the tomato paste and 120ml of water. Cook, stirring constantly, for 3-5 minutes until the paste has deepened in color and the oil starts to separate.\nAdd the ginger paste and sauté for another minute until fragrant.\nStir in the cumin powder, allspice powder, and red chili powder. Sauté for about 30 seconds, stirring continuously.\n\nCombine Lentils and Base:\n\nPour the cooked lentils and kidney beans (along with the cooking liquid) into the pan with the tomato-onion base.\nMix well and bring to a gentle simmer.\n\nSimmer and Cream:\n\nReduce the heat to low, cover the pan partially, and let the dal simmer for at least 30-45 minutes, or even longer if time permits. This slow simmering helps the flavors meld together and creates a creamy texture. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.\nStir in the fresh cream. Simmer for another 5-10 minutes. Adjust the consistency by adding more cream or a little water if needed. Check and adjust the salt.\n\nGarnish and Serve:\n\nGarnish with thinly sliced fresh ginger juliennes and a squeeze of lemon juice at the end.\nServe hot with naan, roti, paratha, or rice. A dollop of extra butter or cream on top is often added before serving for extra richness.\n\nKey to Dal Makhani’s Richness:\n\nWhole Black Lentils and Kidney Beans: These specific lentils and beans contribute to the unique texture and flavor.\nSlow Cooking: Long, slow simmering is essential for developing the rich and creamy consistency.\nButter and Cream: Generous use of butter (or ghee) and fresh cream is what gives Dal Makhani its signature luxuriousness.",

Heat over medium-low heat, stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved. Do not boil. Remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature. This step is crucial for “state fair” quality lemonade, as it prevents a gritty texture from undissolved sugar.\nJuice the Lemons: While the simple syrup cools, squeeze your lemons to get about 240ml of fresh lemon juice. Roll the lemons on the counter before cutting them in half to help extract more juice. Strain out any seeds or excessive pulp if you prefer.\nCombine Ingredients: In a large pitcher, combine the cooled simple syrup and the fresh lemon juice.\nAdd Water and Adjust: Gradually add 720-960ml of cold water, stirring well after each addition. Taste the lemonade as you go and adjust the amount of water to achieve your desired level of sweetness and tartness. Some prefer a stronger, more tart lemonade, while others like it sweeter.\nChill and Serve: For best results, chill the lemonade in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. This allows the flavors to meld and ensures it’s refreshingly cold. Serve over ice, with lemon slices for garnish if desired.\n\nNote: You can add some lemon zest to the syrup for extra flavor. You can also use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh if time is a factor.",
