The overhang is crucial for lifting and rolling the roulade. You can also lightly grease the parchment paper for extra insurance against sticking.\n\nMake the Egg Base:\n\nIn a large mixing bowl, whisk the 4 large eggs until they are light and slightly frothy.\nWhisk in the milk or cream until well combined.\nSeason generously with salt and pepper.\nIf desired, whisk in any optional flavorings like chopped herbs, grated cheese, or spices.\n\nBake the Egg Base:\n\nPour the egg mixture evenly onto the prepared 23x33cm pan.\nBake for 10-15 minutes, or until the eggs are just set and no longer liquid in the center. The surface should be slightly spongy to the touch. Be very careful not to overbake, as this is the most common reason for cracking.\n\nCool Slightly and Add Filling:\n\nRemove the pan from the oven and let the egg sheet cool for about 5 minutes. This makes it easier to handle.\nCarefully loosen the edges of the egg sheet from the parchment paper using a thin spatula or knife.\nEvenly distribute your chosen filling ingredients over the surface, leaving a small border (about 1.25cm) along one of the long edges to help with rolling.\n\nRoll the Roulade:\n\nStarting from one of the long edges, begin to gently roll the egg sheet up like a jelly roll. Use the parchment paper overhang to help you lift and guide the roll. Roll it tightly and evenly.\nOnce fully rolled, position the roulade seam-side down on the baking sheet (still lined with parchment).\n\nHeat Through (Optional):\n\nIf you want to melt cheese or heat the filling, you can return the rolled roulade to the oven for another 5-10 minutes.\n\nCool and Serve:\n\nLet the roulade cool for a few minutes before slicing with a sharp knife. This will help it hold its shape and prevent the filling from oozing out.",

    "section": "1.5 The Perfect British-Style Scone for the American Kitchen",
    "text": "1.5 The Perfect British-Style Scone for the American Kitchen\nThere is a moment of pure, simple bliss that comes from breaking open a warm, freshly baked scone. Not the dense, sugar-laden triangles you might find at a coffee shop, but a true British scone—impossibly light, flaky, and buttery, with a golden top and a soft, tender crumb. It’s a taste of tradition, a cornerstone of the classic “cream tea.”\nThis recipe bridges the gap between the hallowed halls of British baking and the modern American kitchen. We’ll use ingredients that are easy to find, like all-purpose flour and buttermilk, and employ simple techniques to achieve that authentic, melt-in-your-mouth texture. Forget dry, heavy scones; these are lofty, elegant, and ready to be slathered with your favorite jam and a dollop of cream.\n\n1.5.1 The Four Secrets to a Perfect Scone\n\nCold Ingredients are Non-Negotiable: Your butter and liquids must be very cold. When small pieces of cold butter hit the hot oven, they release steam, creating tiny pockets of air that result in a light, flaky texture.\nA Gentle Hand is Key: Overworking the dough develops gluten, which leads to tough, chewy scones. Mix until the ingredients are just combined. A shaggy, slightly sticky dough is a good sign.\nPat, Don’t Roll: While you can use a rolling pin, gently patting the dough to thickness with your hands prevents over-compacting it, keeping the final product tender.\nCut Cleanly: When cutting your rounds, press the cutter straight down and pull it straight up. Don’t twist! Twisting the cutter seals the edges of the scone, preventing it from rising to its full, glorious height.\n\n\n\n1.5.2 The Recipe\nYields: 8-10 (2.5-inch) scones Prep time: 15 minutes Bake time: 12-15 minutes\n\n\n1.5.3 Ingredients\n\n360g All-Purpose Flour, plus more for dusting\n50g Granulated Sugar\n12g Baking Powder\n3g Salt\n113g (8 tbsp / 1 stick) Unsalted Butter, very cold, cut into 1/2-inch cubes\n1 large Egg\n180ml Buttermilk, very cold (see Baker’s Notes for substitutions)\n1 large Egg, beaten with 15ml of milk or cream (for the egg wash)\n\n\n\n1.5.4 Equipment\n\nLarge mixing bowl\nPastry blender or two knives (or a food processor)\n2.5-inch round biscuit or cookie cutter\nBaking sheet lined with parchment paper\nPastry brush\n\n\n\n1.5.5 Instructions\n\nPrepare Your Station: Preheat your oven to 200°C (400F). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.\nCombine Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt.\nCut in the Butter: Add the cold, cubed butter to the flour mixture. Using a pastry blender or your fingertips, quickly cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces of butter still visible. (For modern convenience, you can pulse the dry ingredients and butter in a food processor 8-10 times until the correct texture is reached. Then, transfer to a bowl.)\nMix the Wet Ingredients: In a separate small bowl, whisk the egg and the cold buttermilk together until just combined.\nForm the Dough: Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients. Use a fork or a spatula to mix until a shaggy, slightly sticky dough begins to form. Do not overmix! It’s okay if there are a few dry patches.\nA Quick Knead: Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Gently and quickly knead the dough just 3-4 times to bring it together into a cohesive ball. It should still look a little rough.\nPat and Cut: Gently pat the dough into a round that is about 3/4-inch to 1-inch thick. Using a 2.5-inch round cutter dipped in flour, press straight down to cut out your scones. Do not twist the cutter. Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet, about an inch apart. Gently bring the scraps together, pat down, and cut out more scones until all the dough is used.\nThe Finishing Touch: Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the tops (but not the sides) of the scones with the egg wash. This will give them a beautiful, glossy golden-brown finish.\nBake: Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the scones have risen high and are a lovely golden brown.\nCool: Transfer the scones to a wire rack to cool slightly. They are best served warm on the day they are made.\n\n\n\n1.5.6 Baker’s Notes, Variations & Serving\n\nButtermilk Substitute: If you don’t have buttermilk, you can make a quick version. Add 1 tablespoon (15ml) of lemon juice or white vinegar to a measuring cup, then add enough whole milk to reach the 3/4-cup (180ml) line. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes before using. Alternatively, you can use heavy cream for a richer, more decadent scone.\nClassic Fruit Scones: For a traditional variation, gently fold 85g of dried currants or raisins into the dough just before you turn it out onto your work surface.\nSavory Cheese Scones: For a savory treat, reduce the sugar to 1 tablespoon. Add 113g of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and a pinch of cayenne pepper to the dry ingredients before cutting in the butter.\nFreezing for Later: You can freeze unbaked scones for future convenience. Cut them out, place them on a tray, and freeze until solid. Transfer to a freezer bag. They can be baked directly from frozen; just add 2-4 minutes to the baking time.\nHow to Serve a Proper Scone: A “Cream Tea” is the traditional way to enjoy scones. This involves serving them with clotted cream and strawberry or raspberry jam. As clotted cream can be hard to find in the U.S., here are some excellent alternatives:\n\nMock Clotted Cream: Beat 1 cup (240ml) of cold heavy cream to stiff peaks. In a separate bowl, whisk 113g of mascarpone cheese with 8g of powdered sugar until smooth. Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone.\nLightly Sweetened Whipped Cream: A simple and delicious option.\nCrème Fraîche: Offers a wonderful tangy richness.",

    "text": "2.2 Homemade Naan (Modified)\nAttribution: Based on the Homemade Naan recipe from Once Upon a Chef.\n\n2.2.1 Ingredients\n\n240-360g all-purpose flour\n13g sugar\n3g instant dry yeast/rapid-rise yeast\n6g salt\n45ml plain Greek yogurt\n30ml extra virgin olive oil\n180ml warm water (about 38°C / 100°F)\n\n\n2.2.1.1 For Brushing\n\n28g (2 tbsp) melted salted butter (for brushing on finished naans)\n3g dried parsley (optional)\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Instructions\n\nMix the dry ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt.\nMix the wet ingredients: In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the Greek yogurt, olive oil, and warm water.\nCombine and stir: Add the yogurt mixture to the dry ingredients and mix with a fork until the dough starts to come together.\nKnead: Dust your hands with flour and gently knead the dough, adding more flour as needed (up to an additional 120g), until it forms a soft, slightly sticky ball that pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Stop kneading as soon as it comes together.\nRise: Lightly oil a clean bowl, transfer the dough to it, and cover with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel. Let the dough rise in a warm place for 1 to 1½ hours, or until it has about doubled in size.\nPrep and divide: Dust a work surface with flour. Turn the risen dough onto the floured surface, shape it into a long rectangle, and cut it into six equal portions.\nHeat the skillet: Heat a large cast iron or heavy nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it is very hot.\nRoll and cook: While the skillet heats, roll one of the dough balls into an oval shape about ⅛-inch (3mm) thick. Gently place the dough in the hot, dry skillet. Cook until bubbles form and the bottom is browned in spots (a few minutes). Flip the naan and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the bottom is lightly browned and blistered.\nFinish and serve: Remove the naan from the skillet and brush with melted butter. Repeat with the remaining dough balls. Sprinkle with dried parsley, if desired, and serve warm.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Notes on Modifications\n\nAnise Seeds: The anise seeds were an optional ingredient in the original recipe, so they have been removed completely.\nGreek Yogurt: Greek yogurt is thicker than regular plain yogurt. The recipe uses the same amount, which should work fine.\nDried Parsley: Dried herbs are more potent than fresh ones. A general rule of thumb is to use one-third the amount of dried herbs as you would fresh. The original recipe called for 1 tablespoon of fresh parsley, so this recipe uses 1 teaspoon (now 3g) of dried parsley.\nFlour: Added up to 120g more flour to help the dough pull away from the bowl.",

Make sure the water is warm to the touch. If you can’t comfortably hold your finger in the water for several seconds, wait for it to cool. Pour the water into the bowl of a stand mixer or large bowl and sprinkle the yeast over top. Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.\nStart the dough. Place the milk, butter, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl and stir to combine. Transfer to the bowl with the yeast, add 120g of the flour, and stir until it forms a loose, lumpy batter.\nAdd the flour. Add 540g of the flour, reserving the remaining flour if the dough is sticky during kneading. Stir until a floury, shaggy dough is formed.\nKnead the dough. Using the dough hook attachment on a stand mixer on medium speed, knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes. (Alternatively, knead the dough by hand on the counter.) If the dough is bubble-gum sticky against the sides of the bowl or the counter, add extra flour a tablespoon at a time until it is no longer sticky. The dough is kneaded and ready when it is smooth, feels slightly tacky, forms a ball without sagging, and springs back when poked.\nDo the first rise. Remove the dough from the stand mixer bowl. Clean and dry the mixing bowl. Coat with a thin film of oil. Form the dough into a ball, place it in the bowl, and turn it to coat all over with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and let the rise in a warm spot until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.\nShape the dough. Sprinkle a little flour on a work surface and place the dough on top. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and shape each piece into a loose ball. Let the balls rest for 10 minutes.\nDo the second rise in the loaf pans. Grease 2 (20cm by 10cm) loaf pans with oil or coat them with cooking spray. Shape each ball of dough into a loaf (see Recipe Notes below for instructions or this tutorial for photos) and transfer to the loaf pans. It’s important that the surface of the loaves be stretched taut; this helps them rise evenly and keep its shape. If your loaf still seems a little loose after the initial folding, just fold it in half again and pinch it closed. We do this by pressing the middle down and drawing up the sides.\nHeat the oven to 220°C (425°F). Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven, remove any racks above it, and heat the oven to 220°C (425°F) about halfway through the second rise.\nSlash the loaves and bake. Using a serrated knife, make a long, shallow slash down the center of each loaf. Place them in the oven. Immediately turn down the heat to 190°C (375°F) and bake 30 to 35 minutes. Finished loaves will be dark golden-brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Remove the loaves from the pans onto wire racks and let cool completely before slicing.\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Recipe Notes\n\nStorage: Loaves wrapped in foil and plastic will keep at room temperature for several days or freeze for up to 3 months.\nHow to Form Loaves:\n\nFlatten into a rectangle. Use the heels of your hands to gently flatten the round into a rough rectangle. If the dough is sticking to the counter, sprinkle a little flour underneath. Try not to use too much flour, though, or else you’ll have trouble getting the dough to stick to itself once you shape.\nFold the bottom third up. This part is like folding a letter! Fold the bottom third of the dough over on itself.\nFold the top third down. Then fold the top of the dough down so that it overlaps the other layers.\nPinch closed. Use your fingers to pinch the dough closed where the top layer meets the bottom layers. Don’t forget the sides!\nFold the dough again. The goal is to get the surface of the loaf as taut as possible. This will help the loaf rise evenly and keep its shape. If your loaf still seems a little loose after the initial folding, just fold it in half again and pinch it closed. We do this by pressing the middle down and drawing up the sides.\nInvert the loaf into the pan. Roll the loaf over until the seam is facing down and then gently place the loaf into the pan. The seams should be on the bottom with the tight surface facing up.",

    "text": "3.2 Peri-Peri Chicken Thighs (Scaled for 3.5 kg)\nThis recipe makes a vibrant and flavorful peri-peri chicken, perfect for grilling. It’s designed for boneless, skinless chicken thighs, and features a unique blend of spices including dried jalapeño flakes, Kashmiri red pepper, and ginger.\n\nYields: 3.5 kg of chicken (approx. 7-10 chicken thighs)\nPrep time: 20 minutes (plus 4-24 hours marination)\nCook time: 15-20 minutes per batch\n\n\n3.2.1 Ingredients\nFor the Marinade:\n\n30-40 ml (approx. 20-25 g) dried jalapeño flakes (see note 1)\n2-3 large red bell peppers\n25-35 g minced garlic (see note 2)\n150 ml rice wine vinegar (see note 3)\n30-60 ml lemon juice (see note 7)\n150 ml olive oil (or neutral oil)\n10-12 g Kashmiri red pepper powder (see note 4)\n3-4 g cayenne powder (see note 5 - adjust to taste)\n8-10 g onion powder\n8-10 g dried oregano\n8-10 g salt (adjust to taste)\n3-4 g black pepper\n5-7 g sugar\n8-10 g ginger paste (see note 6)\nMedium handful of fresh cilantro or parsley (optional)\n\nFor the Chicken:\n\n3.5 kg boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Instructions\n\nPrepare the Marinade:\n\nPrepare Dried Jalapeño Flakes: If your dried jalapeño flakes are very coarse, you can give them a quick pulse in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. They do not typically require rehydration as they will soften in the marinade.\nCombine the dried jalapeño flakes, red bell peppers, minced garlic, rice wine vinegar, lemon juice, olive oil, Kashmiri red pepper powder, cayenne powder, onion powder, dried oregano, salt, black pepper, sugar, ginger paste, and optional fresh herbs in a blender or food processor (you may need to blend in batches depending on blender size).\nBlend until the mixture is completely smooth. You can use a small amount of water or the jalapeño soaking liquid (if you rehydrated whole dried jalapeños) if needed to achieve a smooth consistency.\nTaste the marinade and adjust seasonings (salt, sugar, and especially heat from cayenne) to your preference.\nReserve about 1/4 of the marinade for basting during grilling and for serving with the cooked chicken. Do not use the reserved marinade on raw chicken to avoid cross-contamination.\n\nMarinate the Chicken:\n\nTrim any excess fat from the chicken thighs.\nPlace the chicken thighs in several large resealable plastic bags or large shallow dishes (you will likely need multiple).\nPour the main portion of the marinade over the chicken, ensuring each piece is thoroughly coated.\nSeal the bags or cover the dishes and refrigerate for a minimum of 4 hours, and ideally 8-24 hours for the best flavor penetration.\n\nBarbecue the Chicken:\n\nTake the chicken out of the refrigerator about 30 minutes before grilling to allow it to come to room temperature.\nPreheat your grill to a two-zone setup: one side on medium-high heat (direct heat) for searing, and the other side on low to medium heat (indirect heat) for cooking through. Lightly oil the grill grates.\nPlace the chicken thighs on the direct heat side of the grill in batches to avoid crowding. Sear for 2-3 minutes per side to get a nice char.\nMove the chicken to the indirect heat side of the grill. Close the lid and continue to cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 74°C (165°F).\nDuring the last few minutes of cooking, you can baste the chicken with the reserved marinade for extra flavor.\nOnce cooked, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before serving.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Notes on Substitutions and Ingredients:\n\nDried Jalapeño Flakes: We are assuming you have dried, crushed jalapeño flakes. If using whole dried jalapeños (which would be approximately 7-9 whole dried peppers for 3.5 kg of chicken), they should be rehydrated by soaking in boiling water for 20-30 minutes before blending. Fresh jalapeños can also be used, but the dried ones provide a more concentrated, smoky flavor.\nMinced Garlic: This is a direct substitution for garlic cloves. Approximately 1 teaspoon of minced garlic (5g) per medium clove.\nRice Wine Vinegar: This was used as a substitute for sherry or red wine vinegar. It offers a milder, slightly sweeter acidity.\nKashmiri Red Pepper Powder: Used for its vibrant color and mild, aromatic heat. If not available, regular paprika can be used, but the color may be less intense.\nCayenne Powder: Used for adjustable heat. This is a potent spice, so start with a small amount and add more to taste. You can also use red pepper flakes if preferred, but cayenne provides a more uniform heat throughout the marinade.\nGinger Paste: This was an addition for an extra layer of warmth, zest, and aromatic complexity. It pairs wonderfully with the other flavors.\nLemon Juice: This measurement assumes the use of readymade lemon juice. If using fresh lemons, the yield can vary, but typically 1-2 lemons will provide approximately 30-60 ml of juice.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "4.1.1 Foundational Principles\nKeep these in mind for gout-friendliness:\n\nProtein: For low-purine options. Chicken (breast is best), turkey, or lean fish. Avoid organ meats, red meats, and shellfish.\nThickener: Use starches like flour, cornstarch, rice, or potatoes to thicken the stew.\nFlavor: Rely on a base of vegetables, herbs, and spices rather than high-purine meat broths.\n\n\n\n4.1.2 1. Building the Flavor Base (The Sauté)\nThis is the most important step for a rich, deep flavor. This is where you start your stew.\n\nFats: 15-30ml of olive oil.\nAromatics: Always start with these. Finely chop onions, shallots, or garlic. Sauté them until they are soft and translucent.\n“Long-Cooking” Vegetables: These need a head start to become tender. Add these after the aromatics and sauté them for a few minutes.\n\nCarrots\nCelery\nParsnips\nTurnips\nHard squash (like butternut or pumpkin)\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 2. Adding the Protein and Spices\nOnce your flavor base is sautéed, it’s time to bring in the main ingredients.\n\nProtein: Add your cubed chicken or turkey. Sauté it until it’s lightly browned on all sides. This adds a great layer of flavor.\nDry Spices: Add your spices now, such as paprika, cumin, oregano, black pepper, and a very small amount of cloves or cardamom. Sautéing the spices for about a minute will “bloom” them and release their full aroma.\nThickener (if using flour): Sprinkle about 30ml of flour over the ingredients. Stir constantly for 1-2 minutes until it coats everything and forms a paste.\n\n\n\n4.1.4 3. The Simmering Stage\nNow you add the liquid and the ingredients that need a long time to cook through.\n\nLiquid: Slowly pour in your unsalted broth or water, stirring to prevent any lumps from forming if you used flour. Add enough liquid to just barely cover the ingredients.\n“Hard” Ingredients: Add any ingredients that require a long cooking time to become tender and help thicken the stew.\n\nPotatoes (cut into large chunks)\nRice (120ml is a good start)\nBay leaves\n\nSimmer: Bring the stew to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cover the pot and let it cook for at least 30-45 minutes.\n\n\n\n4.1.5 4. Finishing the Stew\nTowards the end of the cooking process, add the ingredients that cook more quickly.\n\n“Quick-Cooking” Vegetables: These will become mushy if added too early. Add these 15-20 minutes before the stew is done.\n\nBell peppers\nCabbage\nZucchini or summer squash\nMushrooms\n\nRemaining Thickener: If you didn’t use flour and the stew isn’t as thick as you want, mix cornstarch with a little cold water to make a slurry. Stir it in and simmer until thickened.\nSeasoning and Fresh Herbs: Once the stew is ready, remove the bay leaves. Taste and add salt as needed. Stir in fresh herbs like chopped parsley or basil to add a bright flavor.",

    "text": "4.2 Karachi Chicken Karahi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nActual Karachi-style chicken karahi wouldn’t use an onion. I do. We like the addition of the umami notes. You do you.\nThis is a lot of oil. Evidently the oil separation (or “tarka”) is a desired visual cue in a good karahi. Frying the tomato paste and masala before the chicken has helped absorb the oil, but a tarka is still present after the dish stands for a little.\nThis recipe is scaled to a can of tomato paste. This is because:\n\nTomato paste is already cooked, so you don’t need as much time to develop the tomato flavor.\nChicken available in America has a lot more water than desi chicken. Using tomato paste instead of tomatoes or tomato sauce helps us keep the dish from getting watery.\nThis isn’t a lot of tomato paste, but cooking it first gets the maximum amount of flavor from the one can. If you don’t cook it first, you’ll probably want a second or third can.\nThe amount of oil and water is also approximately one 6oz can, so you can reuse the tomato paste can for a measure.\n\nFor a charsi or Peshawari-style karahi omit the onion, tomato, and spices other than salt and pepper.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1 Ingredients\n\nChicken: about 1.5 kg (3.3 lbs) boneless chicken thighs\nGhee or Oil: 120ml\nOnion: 1 medium onion, finely diced\nTomato Paste: 1 can (170g)\nGarlic: 75ml, minced or crushed\nGinger: 75ml, minced or crushed (plus a small amount, julienned, for garnish)\nWater or Chicken Broth: 120ml\nGreen Chilies: 6-8, slit lengthwise\n\n\n4.2.1.1 Spices:\n\nSalt: 12-18g\nCoriander Powder: 6g\nCumin Powder: 7g total\nRed Chili Powder or Paprika: 6-10g\nBlack Peppercorns: 7g, freshly crushed\nAllspice: 1g Note: Use at the end!\n\n\n\n4.2.1.2 Garnishes:\n\nFresh Cilantro: A generous handful, chopped\nFresh Ginger: A small amount, julienned\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Instructions\n\nSauté the Onion: Heat the ghee or oil in a large wok or pot over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 8-10 minutes until it is soft and translucent.\nBloom the Tomato Paste: Add the tomato paste to the wok and stir it in with the onion. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the color deepens.\nAdd Aromatics: Add the minced ginger and garlic. Add the coriander powder, 6g of cumin powder, red chili, and black pepper. Cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.\nFry the Chicken: Add the chicken pieces to the wok. Increase the heat to high. Stir well and cook for 5-7 minutes until the chicken is browned and the spices are fragrant.\nSimmer: Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add 120ml of water or broth. Stir, then cover and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is tender. The sauce should be thick.\nFinal Touches: Remove the lid and increase the heat to high. Cook and stir for a few minutes until the sauce thickens and the oil begins to separate from the masala. If there is an excessive amount of oil, you can carefully tip the wok and spoon some of it out.\nAdd Finishing Spices: Turn off the heat. Stir in the green chilies, julienned fresh ginger, chopped cilantro, the remaining 1g of cumin, and the 1g of allspice.",

Add the tomato paste and a little bit of the warm water to create a slurry. Add the minced garlic, ginger, turmeric, cayenne, paprika, 4g of the cumin, and 0.5g of the allspice. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1-2 minutes until the spices are fragrant and the paste has deepened in color.\nPressure cook: Pour in the remaining warm water, stirring to deglaze the pot and mix with the tomato paste and spice mixture. Add the salt, then place the chicken pieces on top of the sauce.\nLock the lid into place. Select Manual or Pressure Cook and set the timer for 10 minutes on high pressure.\nWhen the cooking is complete, let the pressure release naturally. Carefully remove the chicken and set it aside.\nUsing an immersion blender, blend the sauce until it is smooth. Let the sauce cool for a few minutes.\nAdd the cubed butter, heavy cream (or your chosen substitute), the remaining 1g of cumin, and 0.5g of allspice. Stir until well incorporated. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.\nRemove half of the sauce and freeze it for later, or refrigerate for up to 3 days.\nAdd the chicken back to the pot, cut into bite-size pieces if desired. Set the Instant Pot to Sauté on low heat and let the chicken heat through.\nServe warm.",

Strain and reserve the juices.\nLine a half sheet pan with parchment paper and place the ground meat in the middle of the pan. Cover the meat with a large sheet of plastic wrap and roll out the meat with a small rolling pin into a large rectangle that covers the surface of the pan; it will be very thin.\nAdd a thin layer of yellow mustard and season the meat with the spice mixture. Pick up the edge of the parchment and fold the meat in half, widthwise. Roll a couple of times just to seal the two layers.\nRefrigerate for 10 minutes then cut into 8 even squares with a pizza cutter.\nPreheat a griddle pan over medium heat. Spread the onions out on the griddle in an even layer in a rectangular shape. Put the patties on top of the onions. Resist the urge to press them with your spatula. Squeezing burger patties is the culinary equivalent of picking at a scab, and you remember what your mom told you about that.\nPour over some of the remaining onion juice to create steam. Top each patty with a slice of cheese and the bottom half of a bun. Cover the griddle with foil (but do not seal) and reduce the heat to low. Steam the burgers until cooked, 3 to 5 minutes.\nConstruct burgers thusly: Add pickles and mustard to each bun top. Using a large spatula, pick up a burger-bottom bun stack and place it on the top half of a bun. Repeat with the remaining burger stacks and bun tops until there’s nothing left to build. Consume mass quantities.",

    "text": "4.9 Dal Makhani\n\n4.9.1 Ingredients\n\nWhole Black Lentils (Urad Dal): 200g\nKidney Beans (Rajma): 50g\nWater: 960-1200ml (for soaking and cooking)\nSalt: To taste\nButter or Ghee: 30-45g (2-3 tbsp)\nOnion: 1 medium, finely chopped\nGarlic: 1-2 cloves, minced (just omit for garlic allergies)\nGinger Paste: 15g\nTomato Paste: 60g (approx. 2-3 tablespoons)\nWater: 120ml (for blooming tomato paste)\nCumin Powder: 5g\nAllspice Powder: 0.5g\nRed Chili Powder: 1g (adjust to taste)\nFresh Cream or Heavy Cream: 120-240ml\n\n\n\n4.9.2 Preparation\nSoak the Lentils and Kidney Beans:\n\nRinse the urad dal and rajma thoroughly under cold water.\nSoak them together in at least 960ml of water overnight (8-12 hours). This is crucial for proper cooking and achieving the right texture.\n\nCook the Lentils and Kidney Beans:\n\nDrain the soaked lentils and kidney beans.\nTransfer them to a pot or pressure cooker with fresh water (enough to cover them by about 5cm). Add salt to taste.\nCook until they are very soft and mushy. This will take longer than other lentils.\n\nStovetop: Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 1-2 hours, or until the lentils and beans are completely tender and can be easily mashed. You may need to add more water during cooking.\nPressure Cooker: Cook for 8-10 whistles on medium heat. Allow the pressure to release naturally.\nInstant Pot: Cook on high pressure for 30-40 minutes, followed by a natural pressure release for at least 15 minutes, then a manual release if needed.\n\n\nPrepare the Base Flavor:\n\nHeat butter or ghee in a separate heavy-bottomed pan or or pot over medium heat.\nAdd the finely chopped onions and sauté until they are golden brown (about 8-10 minutes).\nAdd the tomato paste and 120ml of water. Cook, stirring constantly, for 3-5 minutes until the paste has deepened in color and the oil starts to separate.\nAdd the ginger paste and sauté for another minute until fragrant.\nStir in the cumin powder, allspice powder, and red chili powder. Sauté for about 30 seconds, stirring continuously.\n\nCombine Lentils and Base:\n\nPour the cooked lentils and kidney beans (along with the cooking liquid) into the pan with the tomato-onion base.\nMix well and bring to a gentle simmer.\n\nSimmer and Cream:\n\nReduce the heat to low, cover the pan partially, and let the dal simmer for at least 30-45 minutes, or even longer if time permits. This slow simmering helps the flavors meld together and creates a creamy texture. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.\nStir in the fresh cream. Simmer for another 5-10 minutes. Adjust the consistency by adding more cream or a little water if needed. Check and adjust the salt.\n\nGarnish and Serve:\n\nGarnish with thinly sliced fresh ginger juliennes and a squeeze of lemon juice at the end.\nServe hot with naan, roti, paratha, or rice. A dollop of extra butter or cream on top is often added before serving for extra richness.\n\nKey to Dal Makhani’s Richness:\n\nWhole Black Lentils and Kidney Beans: These specific lentils and beans contribute to the unique texture and flavor.\nSlow Cooking: Long, slow simmering is essential for developing the rich and creamy consistency.\nButter and Cream: Generous use of butter (or ghee) and fresh cream is what gives Dal Makhani its signature luxuriousness.",

Heat over medium-low heat, stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved. Do not boil. Remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature. This step is crucial for “state fair” quality lemonade, as it prevents a gritty texture from undissolved sugar.\nJuice the Lemons: While the simple syrup cools, squeeze your lemons to get about 240ml of fresh lemon juice. Roll the lemons on the counter before cutting them in half to help extract more juice. Strain out any seeds or excessive pulp if you prefer.\nCombine Ingredients: In a large pitcher, combine the cooled simple syrup and the fresh lemon juice.\nAdd Water and Adjust: Gradually add 720-960ml of cold water, stirring well after each addition. Taste the lemonade as you go and adjust the amount of water to achieve your desired level of sweetness and tartness. Some prefer a stronger, more tart lemonade, while others like it sweeter.\nChill and Serve: For best results, chill the lemonade in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. This allows the flavors to meld and ensures it’s refreshingly cold. Serve over ice, with lemon slices for garnish if desired.\n\nNote: You can add some lemon zest to the syrup for extra flavor.
