## Boardwalk Lemonade

Attribution: Replicated from Ocean City, NJ boardwalk lemonade.

### Ingredients

*   240ml freshly squeezed lemon juice (about 4-6 large lemons)
*   200g granulated sugar
*   960-1200ml cold water (adjust to taste)
*   Ice

#### For Garnish

*   Optional: lemon slices for garnish

### Instructions

1.  **Make a Simple Syrup**: In a small saucepan, combine 200g of sugar and 240ml of water. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved. Do not boil. Remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature. This step is crucial for "state fair" quality lemonade, as it prevents a gritty texture from undissolved sugar.
2.  **Juice the Lemons**: While the simple syrup cools, squeeze your lemons to get about 240ml of fresh lemon juice. Roll the lemons on the counter before cutting them in half to help extract more juice. Strain out any seeds or excessive pulp if you prefer.
3.  **Combine Ingredients**: In a large pitcher, combine the cooled simple syrup and the fresh lemon juice.
4.  **Add Water and Adjust**: Gradually add 720-960ml of cold water, stirring well after each addition. Taste the lemonade as you go and adjust the amount of water to achieve your desired level of sweetness and tartness. Some prefer a stronger, more tart lemonade, while others like it sweeter.
5.  **Chill and Serve**: For best results, chill the lemonade in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. This allows the flavors to meld and ensures it's refreshingly cold. Serve over ice, with lemon slices for garnish if desired.

**Note:** You can add some lemon zest to the syrup for extra flavor. You can also use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh if time is a factor.
